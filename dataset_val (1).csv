"Moving back home isn't an option. I won't be able to get and hold a job for much the same reason I can't graduate - an inability to be among others for any notable amount of time. I had hoped to get a stay at home job upon graduating, but without a degree that possibility is closed to me.

I have roughly $20k to my name and my expenses are minimal. All I want is to keep to myself and not constantly worry about food and shelter, but I know nothing about essentials such as cooking or apartment searching.

Is there any hope that I'm not seeing or do I only have a year left to live?",2.0,"moving back home isnt an option, cant gradute therefore cant get a job, donít want to worry about essentials"
"It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified. They feel worse because you feel like you have an escape in love but you don't and you never will. You start fantasizing over and over about the ""salvation"" of your life, the only source of possible happiness that you can imagine, and the more time passes the worse it gets. It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why?
I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad. So so bad.

I feel like I'm kind of dead, I don't mind living now, I don't really want to die anymore but I can't seem to feel almost anything. I'm never happy or sad anymore and the worst is, I can't empathise with others anymore. The only thing I ever appreciated in myself was how I sincerely cared for others and now I just can't feel it anymore. I don't feel anything to people who used to make me happy when I was at my worst too.

"Hi.  I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 15 and I've been like this since I was 11.  I don't want to do anything anymore.  Everything just seems... boring.  I'm quite sick of everyday repetition.  Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep.  I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before.

"Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. 

So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?",5.0,"it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing"

"You know those times where absolutely everything is just falling apart that you can almost time it by your watch for when the next thing will blow up? Well, there was car issues, pipes froze in my house (because I was dumb), more stuff went and then yesterday I lost a friend because saying that I was lonely  and I mentioned she hasn't visited my new place yet = ""I want to fuck you big time"". We were in the same depression mental health group for 5 weeks together, so she should have understood what I was meant rather than this girl logic and then blocking me without appeal.

Anyways! That isn't the end of it. This one is a totally isolated case from the last but I lost ANOTHER friend. Back to back days. The house is falling down and it decides to drop the toilet on my head for good measure when it's crumbling around me (and it's filled with crap). Anyways! I'll give the quick version. We met on Tinder. Talked for 2 months, had sex a few times a month ago. She was busy with work for the last couple of weeks coming up on Xmas. I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied on the 25th. We talked about meeting up when she was back in town and she said she would let me know with a smiley emoticon.. Normal fare right? Not with passive aggression in play... We didn't chat these entire 5 days until she messaged me in the morning today... I was completely blown away by how fucking dumb this was. I'll just copy paste it...

""Hey XXXXXX, I've had some time to think and, I'll be honest, I don't think I want to see you again. The first time we met I told you that I'm an egalitarian, and so far you have somehow managed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic and I just can't see past that. Whatever this was was fun for a bit, but it was ruined for me by all the hateful shit you say. Maybe take some time and figure out why you see the world the way you do.""

Out of ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I looked back over my entire SMS history to find absolutely anything off key and I couldn't find a single thing. It gets even more stupid and this is how I knew I was dealing with a completely fucked person and it wasn't anything I did.

I replied to her ""I hope one day you develop a mental disease so I can come chop you down at your knees"" (referring to her cutting me apart over my severe depression altering how positively I see the world and hoping that what goes around comes aroubd) and this fucking nut responds to me ""a normal person wouldn't blah blah blah, you *albeist* fuck"". She COMPLETELY loses the plot and insinuates that I hate disabled people because I hoped that she got her just desserts with someone shitting on her when she's vulnerable like I am... Like.. I can't make this stuff up guys.. 

That's where the ball stops with me and I just let her have it. So much BS packed into this and continually tell her ""what is your deal, I don't get it"" and ""you know you're busting down a sweet guy for no reason right?""

This is an open and shut case. We have here a nut case. Rhyme time. She's one of those people that takes everything way too seriously and makes life a real misery for people that don't conform to her exact wording/lifestyle.

THIS was the most fucked up thing though.... We talked for 2 entire months and there was absolutely no scent of crazy fucker to be smelt. She snuck right up on me and suckerpunched me with this nonsense. This is a lesson that everyone should learn. People are really fucking awesome at faking being a nice person that's there for you and if you so happen to have higher stakes such as a child or a joint bank account with one of these sleeper cells, that is some really scary shit and it could hurt a lot of us..

Anyways, I'm just kind of numb to all of this bad news lately.. It hasn't really hurt me like a break up with a loved one would. But it makes me look inward and wonder if I'm a bad person? We only ever shared happy times and laughs and I tried to convey that I'm a sweet person (her car was vandalized and I was offering to come down and assist her and I only knew her for 2 weeks. Stuff like that) but then this almost conspiracy like fog comes back around me and fucks yet another relationship up. What does everyone think of this one?

(I have to add that this is a person whom conversed with me for many months and did me several times. She had no problem fucking a bigot because I'm not one and I don't think if anyone who had that big of a problem with those types of people, would have sex with someone like that.

"Depression it‚Äôs a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn‚Äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel.

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn‚Äôt leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn‚Äôt sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right?

I'm so tired, everytime I eat I feel sick. 
But the thing is my mind feels okay and
Yes I've had suffered from depression many 
Times before, also a few other things. I see 
My doctor on a regular basis, but of late it's 
Been hard finding the right time. It wasn't until 
A few days I thought my body might be depressed,
I started thinking about the stuff that has been 
Going on with me for the last few months and I 
Remember that I had a major operation about 
7 months ago and that's when it all started and
Has gotten worse over time. The reason that
I'm asking here is because I don't want to 
Worry family or friends and I find it hard to talk 
To them about this stuff because they don't 
Really understand it. So my question is can your 
Body get depressed without you knowing it???

"It's 4:18 AM as I'm typing this, and I can't sleep. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, but I couldn't stop thinking and stressing about going back to work after the holidays. Before I knew it, I was about to break down and hyperventilate or cry. I didn't want to wake up my fianc√©e, so I got up and I'm now sitting in the livingroom. I'm sorry for whining when I know other people have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent.

I'm almost 30 years old, the son of the owner of a local business in a small town located in Qu√©bec, Canada. I work for his company, which deals in the sales and repair of commercial and industrial equipment. On paper, I work in sales; in reality, I do practicality everything except for repairs, including but not limited to sales, purchasing, quotations, invoicing, customer service at the counter, on the phone and online, retail item placement and management, parts and equipment research, shipping and receiving, data entry and processing, IT, webmaster, infographics and promotional materials. I also manage our team to some degree and replace the boss and our accounts receivables/payables (his girlfriend) whenever they're away, so I handle late payment complaints even though I can't do anything about it. I'm bilingual and so almost all communications in English are done through me.

That may sound like a fair bit, but I then I also do approximately 75% of one of my colleagues' work because he quite simply can't be arsed to do it. He'll act like he's super busy doing one task whereas I'm typically juggling (no joke) between 5 and 8 tasks at any time, yet I often find him playing solitaire or stretching and loudly yawning at his desk, even when customers are waiting at the counter. A couple summers ago, for two years in a row, when we were the only employees in front, he literally spent hours sleeping at his desk while I alone held the fort throughout our busy seasons. He's approaching retirement age and has been involved with the family for decades; he's not going anywhere.

The foreman in charge of managing repairs and our crew of mechanics routinely vanishes, either going out for errands that take a suspicious amount of time to run, going upstairs to do work for his own company on our dime, spending half an hour in the washroom (upstairs for some reason), running home for one reason or another, or just plain nowhere to be found for no known reason. He fails to properly submit quotations to most customers and fails to properly fill out repair files, so we have to inform customers and make out invoices at the counter when they come in. He also gets me to find parts and pricing as well as place orders for him because he seemingly doesn't feel like doing that himself, maybe because that would cut into his Facebook time. He's typically 15-30 minutes late each morning and afternoon, but he takes off at closing time on the dot, if not a few minutes early. I think it's fair to say that I effectively do about half of his job for him. He's family and is seemingly unfireable for some reason, despite the fact that he's hurting the company badly.

I'll admit I'm usually about 5 minutes late in the morning; I barely get any sleep and never feel rested from any sleep I do get, so it takes a lot of time and motivation to get up and going. That doesn't make it right and I'm ashamed of this bad habit, but I work an extra hour or two everyday, unpaid. I get paid 40 hours a week, but typically work about 50 hours a week. I get reprimanded for being late and for being sick, but unpaid hours go unmentioned. I don't have any fancy diplomas, but I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I was a hard worker, maybe even a workaholic.

My father's family is pretty well known locally and is fairly affluent, so customers tend to assume that I'm well off, but they couldn't be further from the truth. I get paid a few dollars more than minimum wage and that's it; no benefits, no commission, no overtime pay, no extra vacation days and no share of the company's profits. I make just enough for my fianc√©e and I to survive and afford necessities, and that's about it. Last winter, I couldn't even afford heating, so I had to borrow money to buy fuel oil. Meanwhile, two of my cousins had their houses custom built, one of them spends half his time on vacation with his family and the other's heading to Las Vegas soon, and my other cousin doesn't work but has all her expenditures and house paid for by her dad.

If I dare to complain about my financial difficulties, I get talked down to by my father and his girlfriend and told that I should save up (what is this concept of having leftover money at the end of the month???). They say that my fianc√©e should find work, but they don't pay her for the work she does for them. She's a self-employed web designer, artist and programmer; unfortunately, times are tough in that line of business here. She has however done thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work for them, including 3-4 professional websites, and continues to assist them. Any amount she makes goes straight to paying off our debts (credit card) or contributes to paying our expenditures.

My father wants me to buy the business from him so that he has a retirement fund that allows him to keep up his current lifestyle, which includes going on vacation abroad 4-5 times a year, not including camping trips in his RV. However, he refuses to do anything about the obvious issues currently going on and refuses to adapt to the changing market. Suggestions always get turned down and he resists any improvements that I and my only helpful colleague attempt to make. I also routinely have to put up with my father's infantile tantrums and the fact that he doesn't trust me to do anything, resorting to ""micromanaging"". Recently, he doubted my ability to read a PDF in front of a supplier, which was embarassing, and couldn't let me compare invoices (that he asked me to compare) and tried to take over my computer while I was using it so he'd show me how to do my job. It's an extremely stressful work environment, but it's also the way my father has always been with me, and I'm fairly sure that's played a large part in the fact that I have no self-confidence and can't connect with people.

The end result of all the above is that I come home late everyday, exhausted both physically and especially mentally. I barely get any real sleep, my stomach frequently gives me trouble and I suspect that's due to stress, and every little thing feels like a huge challenge. I'm under massive stress because I know very well that if any emergency occurs, if anything breaks or worse, I'm completely unable to afford to solve the issue. Instead, I have to rely on the pity of others, typically my father's if he feels like it (with a healthy dose of acting like he's being generous instead of paying me according to my work), and live with the shame of it. I've always had an exceptional patience with people, but lately the stress has been building up and I've begun snapping at people, worst of all my loving and supportive fianc√©e without whom I wouldn't even be around right now.

I've been depressive for over 15 years now and coping with it, but I think this is my lowest point yet. The last week before the holidays, I stood alone in the shipping area and slowly dug a box cutter knife into my left wrist. I was, quite literally, an inch away from ending my life, but it barely left a mark and looks like a skin fold now. I don't want to leave my fianc√©e and our cats though, and I especially don't want them to end up in financial trouble. I have a life insurance, but the payout is minimal and they wouldn't cover suicide before at least another year and a half.

I'm going back to work on Monday, less than a week from now. At this point, I only see a few ways out...

- Winning the lottery: Essentially a miracle, but also our only hope of fulfilling any dreams or projects.

- Leaving: Taking a massive risk and leaving my current job, hopefully to work from home online, possibly burning bridges with a family that I do care for despite it all, but also possibly losing everything.

- Staying: Try to last another year and a half in this situation and then examine my options, possibly a rope.

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I‚Äôve also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They‚Äôve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don‚Äôt know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I‚Äôm going to kill my self and when we hang up I‚Äôm going to do it) 

Sometimes, I‚Äôm close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I‚Äôm not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That‚Äôs not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I‚Äôd feel entirely responsible. 

I feel like I‚Äôve read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren‚Äôt helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don‚Äôt blame them for what they‚Äôre feeling or think they‚Äôre doing anything wrong.

"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family.

Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who‚Äôve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he‚Äôs gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don‚Äôt feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it‚Äôs my family. They‚Äôre religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do.

"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout.

For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups. I was the only one in my tiny department (besides the guys who work in the back and don't really interact with those of us up front) not to get invited to a coworker's wedding.

Sometimes I honestly wonder if I'll ever have friends again. Honestly. That sounds so melodramatic but I can never get past ""acquaintance."" I can't even get people to add me on fucking Facebook.

"I spend most of my time with others pretending to be ok. Even around those closest to me, whom I've told honestly of the severity of my depression. 

If I don't, I feel worse. I feel bad for bringing everyone down, I feel bad for 'not trying hard enough' to have a good time. Like I'm intentionally doing harm to my loved ones just by acting how I feel.

So I act, I smile and laugh at their jokes or make lighthearted comments about whatever we are doing, but its an act. The entire time I'm exhausting what little energy I have just to seem normal enough they wont leave me.

But then... they actually think I'm fine. Even though I have told them it's acting. I've broken down on more occasions then i can count now. Begged for someone to help me. Begged for some support, or even just a friendly ear. And they're always nice while I'm crying, they listen to me blither for a while and promise to help.

The next day I'm faking it again cause the guilt of making them feel so bad yesterday is overwhelming. I think they'll remember, that they'll ask and actually care how I'm feeling. I think they may at the very least try to check in on me, or pick up some of the slack around the house. They might offer to drive me to my doctors, or really any gesture of support.

But weeks go by. They act like it never happened, like I never told them how I'm really feeling. So I break down again. Beg for help again. Explain it all again. They think I've actually been fine these past few weeks, even though I had blatantly told them I was acting.

Given that the situation prior was hard enough , the trauma and pure gut wrenching pain of questioning the pregnancy as well as my family questioning took its tole , work deterriorated and personal happyness was destroyed.

 I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore.

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them.

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation.

"Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ignoring me and I am not sure why. Now I have been crying just about every hour of every day and out of the past 48 hours I have probably slept through 20 of those hours.

"Hi all,

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really.

"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives.

"Hello,

I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends.

Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. 

I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't.

It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted.

I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there.

tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen?

I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again.

"I'm writing this because I've just once again thought about killing myself but this isn‚Äôt even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I‚Äôd say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to. 

Wow‚Ä¶ well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically biasd by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here‚Äôs whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn‚Äôt even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing‚Äôs I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

¬∑  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

¬∑  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

¬∑  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him‚Ä¶ to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that‚Äôs all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don‚Äôt even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media‚Äôs multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I‚Äôd prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don‚Äôt understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn‚Äôt no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that‚Äôs what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don‚Äôt really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf‚Äôer can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don‚Äôt mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don‚Äôt get to train social skills). Sometime‚Äôs I cry sometimes I get so angry I don‚Äôt even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don‚Äôt relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don‚Äôt remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It‚Äôs said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he‚Äôd rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren‚Äôt too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn‚Äôt around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour‚Äôs would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don‚Äôt know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn‚Äôt live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly ‚Äúvisits‚Äù it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don‚Äôt know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn‚Äôt even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again‚Ä¶ (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he‚Äôd show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn‚Äôt for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn‚Äôt get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room‚Ä¶ I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn‚Äôt do shit you couldn‚Äôt trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting‚Ä¶ (that‚Äôs gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk‚Ä¶) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially biasd, I was constantly racially biasd I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn‚Äôt black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn‚Äôt seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that‚Äôs the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn‚Äôt fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that‚Äôs its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn‚Äôt imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn‚Äôt why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn‚Äôt even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn‚Äôt know a single person and couldn‚Äôt get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you‚Äôve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say ‚Äúwhy did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones‚Äù so my mum said ‚Äúill call him back down and he can read again‚Äù, I was called ‚Äú‚Ä¶.. come downstairs and read again‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúWhats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway‚Äù to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn‚Äôt hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don‚Äôt know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband‚Ä¶ Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day‚Ä¶ they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn‚Äôt do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn‚Äôt know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn‚Äôt know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don‚Äôt look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn‚Äôt want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don‚Äôt know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don‚Äôt even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn‚Äôt sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don‚Äôt give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don‚Äôt have to deal with this anymore I really don‚Äôt I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense.

I‚Äôm homeless in a sense - I have no friend nor family; I live with my bf and his abusive family - they are toxic to me and just as toxic to him and so much do i want to leave but where would I go? Sometimes I wanna pack up and run as far as I can but I have no money. At one point midway in 2017 I jad two jobs and all was great till my bf convinced me to get a job at his call center company but policies changed and wages went so down we both axed it; I managed to convince him get back into a warehouse job I had gotten him back into 2016 that pays him very well but me? No job, too much debt, too much student loans so i cant go back to college nor have I been successful at jobs because I dont have much skills and well - Ive only been at two jobs long enough before my depression destroyed that.

I feel the sickness in my brain - in my body and it kills me with these suicidal thoughts (Ive atempted twice before and was inpatient once) but lied to get out with my moms help cause it was scary. Even had two abortions aithin this past year..Never went to therapy or got meds and not I feel the scary effects of all that. Like someone else is trying to drive me out of my own skin..

ive been ungrateful, rude, and lazy, and just wanted things i can never have. i want to say sorry to all those i've hurt.

i miss my girlfriend who i pushed away for lots of reasons. i dont know if it was the right decision but i hate myself for doing it because she didnt deserve that. i miss the way things were. i miss feeling loved and cared for, and even when things were bad i knew that someone was thinking about me and at least wanted the best for me. i dont think we worked all of the time particularly well but i would have put up with that at the time had i known how sad it would make me.

im struggling with my degree.

im sleeping too late but i like the night too much to stop.

i feel like im a ghost and i dont find love in anything anymore. im so desperately lonely but i dont want to let anyone else down. im just really sad and i need help but when i get that help i pretend everything is ok.

i told one of my friends my issues on new years and i think i said too much and i am scared my secret will get out about how i really feel about myself. im not ready for people to know, let alone myself.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made.

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.

I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy.

"I want to live. I'm a little, cheerful girl. I love music. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes.

I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me.

"Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed : 

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

I have recently turned fourteen and I've recently noticed some really weird changes in my feelings and my behaviors.  I'm not sure where to start so I will try to explain my emotional state recently.
Some pretty weird things have been happeing to me latley and I'm not so sure what to think of them.  I've started having these ""episodes"" where I get super upset for no reason (the no reason is actually another problem I've been having which I will get into in just a second) and I'll just start ignoring people who text me which makes them worried and super upset.  And the ""no reason"" has been a super big problem for me and that problem is when other people treat me indifferently?  Its like when someone talks to me and they'll talk to me in a way that makes them seem like they don't care about me (now I want to adress that this is indeed an incredibly selfish point of view but I don't know how to work on it and make it stop or go away) and it makes me feel like total shit and just start hating everthing.  
I've also noticed that I have barley eaten, which is a pretty normal thing for me because I'm super fucking picky and only eat like snack foods french fries and mcdonalds, but now I'm actually getting scared for myself like today I was basically starving so I went to make waffles at 2 fucking AM.  I'm also aware that not eating is a sign of depression which is kinda scary to me as well because I fell like theres a super high chance that I'm depressed but I do not fucking believe it what so ever. 
I hate trying to talk about how I feel about this stuff to other people because I always feel like its me begging for attention because I'm in eighth grade and I'm used to people talking about their ""depression"" for no reason other than attention.  So I always feel like talking about it is just begging for attention (even though that is a stupid way to look at things because people with real depression do need to communicate and get help) and I always feel bad talking to people about it.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

"I feel bad bc I had to turn away the pest control guy today bc my apt was too messy. The last time the pest control people came apparently they complained to my landlord bc the apt was so messy, and then the landlord sent an email scolding me. It pisses me off bc imo as long as I'm not doing any structural or permanent damage to the property I should be able to live in filth if I want to. But I also know that the way I'm living now isn't healthy. I'm just reluctant to clean bc cleaning up would require admitting to myself that the way I'm living now isn't normal or good for me. 

I also find it difficult to eat. I keep cooking too much pasta, realizing I don't want to eat (even when I'm hungry), and leaving it out to stick to the pan or rot. (Yep, turns out if you leave pasta in the sink for a while green stuff will grow all over it!) I think it's partly bc I like the light-headed feeling of not eating enough and drinking too much coffee. It's basically a cheap and easy way to get high. But lately whenever I ""eat well"" I end up getting intense stomachaches anyway. I had a steak yesterday bc I knew I needed protein but I ended up just getting stomach cramps and diarrhea. 

My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work. She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes. In retrospect I totally understand why she'd get so mad (I *was* being disrespectful) but basically it just made me feel intense shame and that everything I do in the kitchen is basically filthy and gross. Also if I i.e. washed the dishes but didn't put them in the dishwasher she'd get just as mad and I think I unconsciously internalized that unless I completely clean up the kitchen I may as well just let everything sit around and rot. 

My main motivation to clean up would be so I could have friends over without feeling ashamed. (So far I've only let one person who I trust see my apt and I still felt like a gross weirdo.) 

The thing is actually I find dish-washing very calmly sometimes. I've found that concentrating on thinking about the process and how cleaning dishes is satisfying makes me want to clean a lot more than beating myself up about how everything is disgusting.

"I have to get this off my chest or I‚Äôm going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that‚Äôs right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn‚Äôt care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I‚Äôve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren‚Äôt getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I‚Äôve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you‚Äôre just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I‚Äôm fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I‚Äôm going to call tomorrow and I‚Äôm asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That‚Äôs right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them ‚Äúdo I have to say I‚Äôm suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??‚Äù It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that‚Äôs a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I‚Äôm truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I‚Äôm NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm simply saying that it‚Äôs no wonder there‚Äôs such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I‚Äôve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else‚Äôs. 
Here‚Äôs the conclusion I‚Äôve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren‚Äôt getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don‚Äôt know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It‚Äôs disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn‚Äôt always this way. Yes, I‚Äôve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I‚Äôd give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don‚Äôt really have anything else to say. I‚Äôve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You‚Äôve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",2.0,

"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten ... Really bad. To the point of not eating very much for the last month or so. My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.

My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

"I mean, it was both awful and great

January was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook. I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. 

In February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, ""search"" (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. 

I was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it's very awkward to get into this when you're around 16, it's interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn't feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl's skin is clean and she's neither super over/underweight, she's fine in my eyes. 

This lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won't get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn't fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that ""those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die"". 

This showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel's back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. 

It really took away my believe in humanity. And I don't mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn't give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. 

And then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn't stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. 

It improved when spring started. I still remember thinking ""I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.""

However, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.

Now, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.

I didn't give a shit about what people thought about me, I've seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren't as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. 

And this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn't care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. 

But... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn't allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn't wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. 

And she doesn't accept that she did this. She always says now ""I didn't forbid anything"" or ""Don't make others responsible for your problems"" or ""You can still see people we know"" or ""Just search for new friends on Facebook"". Worst part is that my dad who actually would've allowed me this didn't step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...

But this made clear that I don't want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.

However, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/

Friday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn't for this, I don't think I could've stayed through the weekend. 

I think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can't even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It's just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don't feel like it's normal. 

I've never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. 

But back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. 

It did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. 

And whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad.

I have no friends. Not real ones. I can't remember the last time one of them initiated contact with me, not on a normal friendship level. I'm everyone's sounding board. I listen to their problems, I offer sympathy and advice, and they go on their way. I have nobody to talk to about my problems because they've all go their own stuff. They wouldn't care anyway. I always have to make the effort and then get nothing back in return. My boyfriend says his friend like me, but that's only because I'm dating their friend. 


I know nobody 'deserves'  friends, but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I try so hard. I put in so much effort to be there for everyone whenever they need. I try to be fun and engaging and talk to people about their interests even though they never show an interest in mine. For example, I won a pretty big prize related to my hobby last month. Everyone knew about it, nobody cared. If my friend won an award, even in something I don't care about, I'd at least be happy for them and congratulate them. But no, nobody even pretended to care. 


I keep thinking if only I was more attractive, people would like me more. Attractive people have friends, right? If only I was smarter. I know I'm smart, but maybe that's not enough? Am I not funny enough? I travel a lot but make a conscious effort not to be obnoxious or pretentious about it. I don't post 200 selfies from my trips or anything like that. My hobby is slightly unique, but still something anyone should be able to relate to. I'm up for anything, I'm adventurous, I always put on a happy face. I just don't understand why my friends keep rejecting me. Whenever I try to make plans someone comes up with an excuse to bail. 


I've tried making new friends. I moved to a completely new city a couple of years ago to try and start fresh, but the cycle continues. 


A few years ago I was supposed to be my best friend's bridesmaid in her wedding. She demoted me from bridesmaid without telling me (I had to find out through Facebook) and then I wasn't even invited to the wedding. And I still don't know why. I've thought about it so many times and I can't think of a single reason for that to happen. She's still 'friendly' with me, so no, there was no fight we had, not even a mild disagreement. Literally nothing I can think of that would have caused that. 


Then a few weeks ago an out of town friend guilted me into letting her crash at my place even though my apartment is way too small and it would be a massive inconvenience. It was super short notice but I felt bad for her so said yes. She never responded to my reply, never showed up, haven't heard from her since. 


I wish I was just being intentionally obtuse but I... Just don't know why I drive everyone away. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it. 


It doesn't help that my mother has replaced me with my nephew.

Not an exaggeration, all of them, even my baby photos. 
Again, I don't know why. My mum and I have a good relationship, hell we're away on holidays together right now! 


I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what more I can offer people. I don't need a best friend, I just want someone to like me.

"In sorry if I don't write back to any replies. my anxiety makes it kind of hard to answer people.. but ill read comments if I do get any.. 

I just had my second son. having to wait until the 17th to get back on my meds. I've been clean from severe self harm for the whole pregnancy. in trying hard to maintain. were all aware I will probably have post partum depression since I suffered so badly last time. its started already. 

we all know how scary it is to see yourself circling the drain. knowing you can't stop the fall. 

I have 3 people besides my toddler and newborn sons. my husband of 7 years, my mom, and my best friend. my best friend I don't really like to reach out to. even though she is amazing, I adore her and she's extremely understanding and supportive (because she struggles the same as me). I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill.

"It seems like my 15-mid 20's I've had depression, I'm 25.

And these last few months hit me hard: I love to learn, I love learning about the world, the universe, programming in C++, etc. But reading philosophy made matters worse, I couldn't even get into discussions like free will or determinism, or simple politics; even worse if nihilism, existentialism, the existence of God, the soul, quantum mechanics, etc. were involved.

I noticed I had problem. I kinda just realized that nobody knows what's going on. Those questions, the big whys and hows are somehow preventing me from carrying on with my life. I was upset because it feels like there were no answers to those things. I still can't think straight, I get very emotional sometimes, crying in secret (I know, I should tell others). I think it has to do with my childhood: My mother is a hoarder, my father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, and they sometimes threatened to harm each other with knives and guns, my father went on long trips away, sometimes the police were involved. My mother would beat me and my brother, with belts or brooms (or la fabulosa chancla), sometimes for doing bad things... that's how they (and us, by proxy) were raised. But my sister and younger brother, haven't been hit once after I was 15. I know they wanted better for me and my siblings, deep down. And I don't want my siblings to feel any similar things, but they still live with my mother in a house full of junk. I want to help my parents, they're divorced now, but I want to help them. Has anyone gone through something similar? Is there anyway to help?

"Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there.

She's left. I'm right.

I drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.

I enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.

I should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. 

So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with ""she was too good for me, anyway"", leave it at that, and move on with my life.

So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.

But, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.

But I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.

Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. 

I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.

Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.

Well, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say ""Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body"" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. 

I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.

But I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.

I can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.

I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.

But maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.

Or maybe none of this actually matters.

"Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for? My depression has gotten really bad again in the past 2 years and I've spent alot of that time in my room or depressed outside in a zoned out state of mind. One of my best buddies which was my Lovebird absolutely loved being around me. They are silly little birds and do really odd things and love to snuggle with you.

But with my depression I used alot of that time being by myself without my bird. Of course like most things you don't realize how incredibly important they are to you till it's too late. When I woke up to find Kiwi dead in her food bowl I was just devastated. It really didn't hit me bad till a few days later when I realized how she could of helped me during my depression and how my depression caused her to live a lonelier life as well. I knew it was my fault 100% why she died and looked into alot of things that I thought were safe for birds that did harm to her. 

I even did a proper funeral box for her, wrapped her in an orange towel, flowers, golden sacred art with quartz crystals and buried her in my backyard. 
It even got the people in the parrot sub to shed some tears. 

Time hasn't helped and I truly feel like a part of me, one of the few remaining pieces of happiness has been torn away from me. No matter what she always wanted to hang out with me and we've been through alot the 10 years I had her. I still remember coming back from the hospital after my suicide attempt where I was gone for a few weeks and when I came home she freaked out when she saw it was me, chirping and flying around the cage like she couldn't believe I was back. I used to meditate with her outside, play all types of games and now its all over.

Sometimes you get that one pet where it's just a really incredible bond and it sucks when something shitty like depression ruins the time I'll never get back with her along with the stress or loneliness I caused her.

If any of you have pets you love, really try to be with them more often to see if they will at least rid your mind of depression or at least have the comfort in knowing that your making them happen. It may not solve your problems but this whole situation has shown me how delicate life is.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn‚Äôt even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can‚Äôt keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i‚Äôve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she‚Äôd be better off if i weren‚Äôt here to burden her.

"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way I‚Äôve been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship that‚Äôs been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldn‚Äôt beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isn‚Äôt perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didn‚Äôt sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I don‚Äôt have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and I‚Äôm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. It‚Äôs like my life is getting back together and I‚Äôm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if you‚Äôre in high school that school isn‚Äôt the devil you see it to be. 

I‚Äôm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities.

"Just a quick rant about my problems to make me feel better and get some weight off my chest. Each paragraph is sorta it‚Äôs own thing.

I‚Äôm almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. I‚Äôm actually doing okay though. That‚Äôs not my worst problem.

I have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet I‚Äôm not happy.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm sad, I just feel numb to things. I don‚Äôt get a feeling like my brain‚Äôs active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. 

My health is bad. I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since I‚Äôve been a teen it‚Äôs been really out of control. It‚Äôs fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. 

Because of my diabetes I can‚Äôt do the only thing I‚Äôve ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. It‚Äôs entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.

I feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didn‚Äôt feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and ‚Äúexciting‚Äù.

I hate school. It‚Äôs where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality it‚Äôs a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and it‚Äôs like a holocaust for young mental health. I‚Äôm smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just don‚Äôt do anything even though I‚Äôm in the upper level classes.

And even if I did great in school, what‚Äôs it for? I don‚Äôt feel interested in doing much else. 

I would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what I‚Äôm living for sometimes; even though other times I can‚Äôt fathom how I‚Äôd feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.

I don‚Äôt like myself. My hair is really bad and I can‚Äôt fix it really, I think I‚Äôm gonna go bald, I just don‚Äôt like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation.

Some days I just want to die;

There'd be no more days of standing by

Wondering why life is full of darkness.

Some days I just want to die,

This pain I can't hardly take...

And I'd rather plunge a stake through my heart

Than keep watching my world fall apart

Piece by crumbled piece.

The world is not my friend or yours,

It feels like nobody truly loves you

Until your lips turn blue and your skin is a lighter hue, your body burned or buried.

And how many more traumas can I carry on my shoulders

Before I stone myself to death with imaginary boulders

Because I feel like a soldier who has no more fight,

No will to live,

No pill to swallow to stop the impending hollow feeling inside?

How many more times can I die

Figuratively, but emotionally, too,

Before I can't handle any more abuse?

How many different ways can I say ""I'm dying"" before someone realizes I am not smiling?

Where can I go when people show their true intentions and I need a place to heal?

Can I come to you?

Together can we steal back our happiness?

Can we give each other something real, something normal, something lovely?

If the answer is no,

I hope you'll simply smother me

And put to rest my aches and pains.

Drain my body drop by drop

Please don't stop or call the cops...

Just do me a favor,

Erase the stains I leave behind

And find a way to smile and shine when I'm gone.

I love you unconditionally

I want to give you the best of me

Show you you're my soul

But I feel a gaping hole in my heart

A wound that stretches further apart every time I open my eyes

The size forever growing

Please, please, please

Please hear my cries

Please give me a chance to speak.

Don't mistake me for weak,

Just know I've fought for so long

And I'm trying so hard to be strong

But some days I just want to die.",5.0,Wondering why life is full of darkness

I have always been an anxious person, always one of those people who worries about the smallest things and blow it up in my head, and I have had bouts of depression but they seem to come and go. I think the problem lies in that I hid this well from my family having lived away for university for 4 years, and when I came home I felt so happy to be back with them, that they never saw me at my bad state.

I have been living at home since graduating, and all has been fine. But I feel I've completely fucked up christmas, having thrown a complete crazy on my family.

I arrived home from a trip to Slovenia with my boyfriend late on NYE - about 9:30pm. They'd waited for us to eat and mum had spent all night cooking. On the way home my phone broke, and for some reason it put me in a horrible mood - usually I'd relax about this but as soon as I came in the house my mum said to 'just chill out and leave it until tomorrow' and said 'it's because you treat these things badly' and for some reason it made me go CRAZY.

 I knew I hadn't treated the phone badly and for some reason i felt so angry that I wasn't allowed to be worried about it (because I worry about my family alot). But I completely overreacted, stormed upstairs crying and shouting about how much I care for them and how they don't care for me, and from then on the evening went MAD. They all ignored me which made me get worse, although from their perspective I probably looked a bitch so I get why, but it made me so mad so I started screaming and throwing things around (again, I have NO idea why I did this, I see RED when I get in these moods). My sister came up and tried to talk to me and said it 'wasn't worth crying over' which again made me mad and I was screaming and screaming about how they should care about my stuff too. She lost her shit then, slammed her door and went to bed. Then my Mum got really upset, packed a bag and went walking, saying she couldn't be around it (she has PTSD, and has struggled with it for ages). Dad followed her, they returned an hour or so later. When they returned, Dad came to speak to me, I confessed everything about my anxiety and bouts of depression and feeling sad sometimes, and that I was sorry. But then I heard my Mum and Sister whispering about me being annoying or something, and I saw red again. I stormed downstairs, started screaming and hitting myself in the head with scissors, and  screaming ""how come they don't give a fuck about me?"". Sister comes downstairs, grabs me by the scuff of my jumper, shouts ""if you don't fucking shut up I'll get you sectioned myself you're being pathetic"", slams me down on the sofa, so I slapped her in the face. I DO NOT hit anyone, never have, but I felt threatened by her and annoyed that she somehow just didn't feel at all supportive. But i get that it would have been a shock to her. She was pissed at me. Lots of crying on my part and we all went to bed. 

The morning came and everyone was so weird, although my Mum and Dad sat me down and said they would make me a doctors appointment. But I don't know if I need one? I have no idea why I reacted so badly, but 50% of the time I am completely happy. 50% of the time I worry like mad, constantly worrying about family dieing, or if they're happy, if my boyfriend is interested in someone else, if people like me, if I'm hated... alot.

But I have NEVER felt so bad now. I feel like I've destroyed the one thing I was certain on, my family. I feel like I've destroyed the happy, innocent view they had of me and I'm now seen as a crazy bitch. I feel like I ruined NYE and that was the last time we'll have together for a while, as my sister lives far away. I feel like I've just fucked up everything. I can't stop crying, I can't stop going over that night in my head, I'm not hungry, I feel hopeless, I feel like my family will never be the same.

And I know I am probably being irrational but I just feel so shit. I want everyone to be happy so badly and I feel I have hurt that, when they have other things to be worrying about and demanding jobs. Now they'll look back at NYE and hate me for it.

I know this is a really long story - sorry. But I feel completely alone and I want the tears to go away, because I feel very overwhelmed. I really wish I could go back to that night and act like a normal person, because if that was the case we'd all be sat around together watching a film and being happy, but we're not, and I miss that. It doesn't happen often anymore and I fucked it.

"I'm really bad at making friends, and worse at moving on when I mess up and lose one. My trust issues make it a lot harder to accept that certain people genuinely care for me.

A few months ago I had a really bad anxiety attack and said a lot of awful things to a friend who had been incredibly amazing and supportive. She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated. After several weeks, I tried to reconnect with some of them, but they definitely want nothing to do with me. I feel ashamed that I've let my depression get this far.

Even if they were to give me another chance, I'm not even sure how to be happy at this point. I know that I will unintentionally make them feel worse, manipulate, and push them away. I don't want to, but I become a really shitty person when I get close to people. In addition, I don't think I would feel any different.

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

"hey guys, this is something that i dont really do. Usually i use reddit for giggle and shits but now that im so depressed and desperate and i have no one to talk to i come here hoping i can pour my heart out before it pours blood out from sharp objects.

there's this girl, my best friend. Known her for like 3 years and i never thought i could love her so much, for in the past i saw her as annoying and stubborn and whiny but as time goes by i couldnt help but fell madly in love with her (without her knowing). I did make a move last summer but she straight out rejected me. We had a big fight and didnt talk to each other for like 2 months, worst 2 months of 2017, wanting to kill myself all the time and constantly being cynical to everybody. 

But we bumped into each other again at the end of November i think and she cried a lot and she hugged me saying she missed me so much and it was like, the warmest hug i've ever had in my entire life and at that moment i realized i dont want to lose her again, it kills me without her, inside and outside. 

But it's happening again, one night when a friend asked me how i was doing (he knew about my feelings for her) so i told him i still had the same feelings and he said that i should give up because she made it clear to him that she didnt want to take a step further with me. So i was very upset that night and i told him i couldnt because i was in too deep and i couldnt back out and nobody could help me back out and that he shouldnt care, nobody should care because i was dead, i was dead from inside to outside and nobody could help me. Only i could help me but i didnt want to. 

So my friend, i dont know what the fuck he has been thinking, thought it would be somehow of a solution to just tell her how am i feeling and you know what, she got all cold and wouldnt talk to me for weeks. I knew what was wrong but i pretended i didnt know anything. I dont want anything to mess with my head rn because im having an exam in a couple days. But i cant stand the harsh and dry tone when i wish her a nice christmas and new year and thank her for her christmas gift, i tried to ignore it and played it cool but deep down i just want to fucking kill myself to see if she cared. 

she said that we need to talk after my exam and i fear that i might get rejected again and it could also seriously damage our friendship too and i fear that we might break it. I dont want to loss her, she's the reason why i stopped thinking about killing myself buf i cant stand just being her friend. I sometimes think am i those cringy love desperate ""nice guy"" neckbeard who hates women because they reject them on the internet but i think im different. I've known this girl for 4 years now and i cant help but love her for who she is, not just some random hottie to DM on the internet. 

you guys can call me a wimp for whining over a subject that people constantly laugh at (the friendzone), i dont care, i just want to write something down to empty my thoughts for a while because the one person whom i always talk to when i have problems is now cold to me. Pls dont say there are other girls or there are many fishes or stuff like that, im told that and i also tell ppl that a lot and im sick of it. It's like when you're dying sick and the doctor tell you not to die and you can miraculously live. I spend too many brain cells picturing the hanging noose and pills and the razor and i smoked a lot (started smoking when she rejected me for the first time) and my chest hurt and i couldnt sleep well at night and i cant smile anymore.

if you make it down here i thank you sincerely for taking time to read and sorry for lack of punctuations and apostrophes because i write this feeling very bad and i couldnt cry though i want to but i just couldnt, i cant and my hands are shaking rn and i want to kill myself so bad rn. help me im suicidal, no you cant",4.0,"she straight out rejected me, wanting to kill myself, started smoking "

"Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now.

"I need some advice on coping techniques or strategies to avoid crying. It happens too often in the middle of conversations or when people are even a LITTLE mean (sometimes even jokingly so).


&amp;nbsp;


-Meds are not an option- I have been on them and they have negatively affected my health so had to quit (blood pressure and weight on various types).

-I have anxiety with depressive episodes (but no mania). Not bi-polar, no clear ""type"". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.

-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).

-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).


&amp;nbsp;


Please provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).

"Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me.

I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier. It seems like no matter which direction I step in, it sucks. So then I look towards suicide, but even that sucks. I wish I would just pass out and wake up from this shitty nightmare.",2.0,"hated school and college, working as a guide, acting , every time end up hating my job, wish I were never born, life sucks"

"Hi, 

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave

"I'm trapped.

I have a job that I can't quit, because my family is reliant on the health benefits, and the income of course, and I'm in a field where I can't just simply find an upwardly mobile position. I also do a rather specific thing so my skill set is not easily translatable to other jobs - IOW I can't even make a lateral move. At this point, I can't go up, I cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). Otherwise I could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won't really be significant nor enough to live off.

I feel trapped.

This is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that's dragging me down. They have health issues, and my job's benefits cover those. But they also have a number of other problems. I don't want to blame my problems on someone else but here's the problem: I've come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. My spouse needs to change. But I can't make them do that. I can't ask or suggest it. If I do I'm met with resistance. My only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which I've been doing for 20+ years. But here's the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and I've come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. Now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where I see it as my spouse's fault that my child is this way. My spouse hasn't been diagnosed, but I'd say they are a hoarder. So is the child. My spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. So is the child. I could go on and on but the basic deal is that I could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it's too much to bear.

It may be my fault for being an ""enabler"" and letting them walk all over me - maybe I'm too weak, I don't know, but I don't feel it's right to force someone else to do something. But I also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.

It doesn't help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.

I think you have to have grounds for a divorce. I don't want to get a divorce - I don't want to be that person - I want it to work out - and it makes me feel like I'm giving up, and running away, which is not what I'm supposed to do. But again, I'm not strong enough to face this issue.

My spouse's issues have also put us in a financial mess. We're barely making it. So I couldn't' get a divorce if I wanted one, because I can't afford a lawyer.

And it seems like EVERYTHING is like that - I can't make more money without spending money I don't have to get a higher degree - which doesn't even guarantee a job. I can't get a divorce without spending money I don't have to do so. I can't afford a therapist because it's going to cost me money.

IOW, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - I'll only wind up deeper in the hole.

I'm not suicidal, and I don't want to make light of depression, but I am at the point where really, there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. But it's like, the only way I'll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and I can finally get rid of all of their trash. But what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we've fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we'll be paying until we're 90, or dead). If I go, well, I guess it won't be my problem anymore.

So I'm trapped again.

Getting out of the marriage - well, even if I could, there'd be child support that I couldn't afford.

So it's either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. Which is not really something I'm considering, so really, I'm trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. My spouse won't change. My child will probably become even worse with age. I'm just going to get more and more distant.

I've considered having an affair - but you know what - I'm not the type of person others are attracted to - I don't have any money so the shallow people aren't attracted to me, and I'd have to pay for a service like an affair site - which I know most aren't really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren't going to have people who are attracted to me becuase I'm the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. Plus, it costs money I don't have.

But you know, I'm not really interested in having an affair. At best it would just be something different to do. And I don't want to treat someone else like that. And I don't want to do that to my spouse. The only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.

I mean, it's almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it's almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.

Kind of like how America treats the majority of its citizens, but I digress. But yeah, the current national climate doesn't help with hope really.

My job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. But I see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...

And I can hear the advice now - that's not going to help.

Basically, my spouse needs to change and if they don't I need to get out. I know they're not going to change. I don't think it's right to give someone ultimatums - I think they need to come to the decision on their own. But it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. And at this point, I've done enough by myself without any support from my spouse I'm don't have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they're not going to accept that there's even anything wrong with what they're doing. I believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).

As im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year. Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room.

All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are ""friends"" and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, ""youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself."" ""You need to eat less"" ""youre a terrible driver"" things like that.

Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.",4.0,"bother and sister are out at separate parties, I feel so alone,  mom rarely talks to me, dad isnt good at being supportive ,stepmom hates me"

"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past bias. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much.

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime.

"Today is my birthday, it's supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be happy. But thing didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others, then my dad blamed it on me. I didn't care but tomorrow I have finals, I'm already stressed out enough. I wanted to go to a library or a coffee shop to study and forget all about this shit, but then my dad pointed at me and said that if I dared to go out I'm out forever. My mom told me to go my room (she's with me, she cares for me and she doesn't want me get hurt). So I went to my room. Inside, I still heard my dad blaming me for the nuisance I didn't ask for. I grabbed my phone and typed ""Thank you"" to all the texts my friends sent me to wish me a happy birthday. I tried to keep myself positive. 
But then the feelings just hit me hard. It was like a switch. The second after that, I already felt the water all over my face as I threw the glass on the floor. 
I felt...satisfied. The inside of me screamed ""Yes, you did it!"". I played safe with all my life, as the sweet little girl I was. But I know my emotions are unstable and my mental is crumble as hell. I never had the gut to do that, I've always swallowed all the hatred and sadness. So this time instead of crying and writing down all the sadness, I actually did something to show it. Of course my parents went to my room immediately. My mom didn't say much but my dad kept saying how disappointed he was. My dad had a perfect picture of a standard family which the females are always gentle and never fight back. So this incident must make him consider me a failure or something like that.
As I cleaned the mess, he just kept talking. Now he blamed it on my mom that she didn't raise me as a good obedient girl. It made me feel maybe I shouldn't have been born at all. I couldn't tell him that before I'm a girl, his daughter, I am a human. I have emotions. I'm not some doll to bend for his liking. 
I love my dad, I know he love me back too. But the difference between the ideal daughter of him and the actual me is miles away.  
I felt like because of the relationship between me and my family I'm living like a switch. I lost interest in living, I don't see the point of moving on. After all, my life will be a boring cycle. I'm scared that someday I will be crazy enough to actually end my life since I always have that thought at the back of my head. Today I already made the first step. I'm constantly pushed and pulled between living a normal life and depression. 
Tomorrow will be very awkward and stiff, I don't know how to face my family and tell them that I'm really crazy and dead inside.
Maybe I'm truly not suitable for living. For all the achievements and love I get, I still feel so empty. Nothing matters. I love some Kpop idols to learn to love someone wholeheartedly and think that they would love me back. It soothes my poor soul and I have someone to think of instead of thinking about my life.

2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)

I wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?

--------

--------

It's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.

I don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.

For a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.

Is physical appearance just the elephant in the room?

Whenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is ""you're not even ugly.""

What about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?

What do I do then?

""Ugly"" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?

I'm fuming.

"I think it‚Äôs safe to say that I‚Äôve been depressed for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I never thought of depression as a possibility for me so I always debunked these shitty feelings and sadness as ‚Äújust a bad streak‚Äù.

When I came to terms with myself and realized I had a problem, it took me a long time to open up to someone and reach out to them. I opened up to my girlfriend at the time. Fuck me was that a terrible decision.

At first she was mostly supportive but as time went on I was ‚Äútoo negative‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù or ‚Äúnever satisfied‚Äù. It was almost like she completely disregarded everything I told her. It pretty much became her being mad that I was depressed.

We hit a rough patch late in my senior year and it only added onto my self hate, my stress, my anxiety, my sadness. I felt everything at once and then I felt nothing. That night I decided I would kill myself only to be unsuccessful.

She and I talked things through and when I eventually told her what happened, she didn‚Äôt just put me down,  no. She called me a liar. The relationship didn‚Äôt last much longer than that but of course when I left I was told that ‚ÄúI should have tried harder‚Äù.

It‚Äôs been half a year since I left her and I have no regrets or wishes to have her back in my life, but fuck me I hate her. I hate her so much. I hate that she was the one I opened up to. Because of the experience I had with her, J am hateful to most people nowadays.

Every day I wake up absolutely loathing the fact that I will have people to interact with. My new friendships and acquaintances are short lived because I get so agitated I leave. I‚Äôve only come to learn that nobody gives a fuck about depression

Not a single person could be bothered that I want to kill myself or fantasize about how great it would be if I got in a fatal accident. There‚Äôs nothing but pretenders in this world that will use my death as a mean to promote themselves as a good person. I can only see myself writing a scathing note about just how much I hate everyone before I die. 

Whenever I do that, I can only hope that it hurts everyone so fucking bad. Hurt them like they hurt me

I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

"Hey guys, this might be pretty long but I have stuff I need to talk about. Oh, and I'm using a throwaway because a family member knows my main account name.

So, I've had depression for as long as I can remember, Originally, I though I was depressed because I was just lonely, so I spent a couple of years on a few dating sites where no one would talk to me because I'm not good looking enough. That made me feel even more worthless than I already did. Until my current girlfriend came along and started a long distance relationship with me. 

When she came into my life, I was in a particularly dark spot where I was having suicidal thoughts constantly and I even got out of bed at one point to grab my scissors and end it all. I eventually decided not to do it and went back to bed. The day after that last part, my girlfriend started talking to me, that was almost 2 years ago now and since she came into my life, I've gotten better and am much happier, generally, than I used to be.

A couple of months or so ago my suicidal thoughts were coming back and I told her about it (she knows everything above this) and then she started freaking out and getting depressed because she felt like she wasn't helping me at all. I reassured her that she was helping me and she didn't need to freak out or get depressed. A couple of days after that, the suicidal thoughts went away for a while.

Lately however, my depression's just really been getting to me and I'm just tired of living. I don't really want any advice, I just want to vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again. Anyway, I'm getting off point here. Sorry about that.

Now, I did say I originally thought I was just depressed because I'm lonely. After being with my girlfriend, we eventually came to the conclusion that it's not really because I'm lonely, I honestly just don't have a reason for it. My life isn't bad, I'm in college and have an amazing girlfriend who wants to spend her life with me. I don't know, maybe I'm just broken or something. I think I should just end this here.

"I've been unhappy for a very long time. I am in high school and I'm currently on my winter break. I've hated school for the last 6 or so years. 

Even though I despise it, I generally do pretty well. In elementary school, I got 90's and stuff without much difficulty. But when I started high school, my marks were a lot lower and I realized I'm not smart like I thought I was. It took me until the last semester of grade 10 until I was satisfied with my grades. I got all 90s and I was pretty proud of myself. I even won an award for history. 

Now I'm in grade 11 and I'm getting 90s in every course except music. I actually am getting a 60% which was the lowest mark I have ever gotten in a course. I'm pretty devastated because I have been practising like crazy. My teacher is also pretty considerate and let me redo a few things which I continued to fuck up. If you are in music, you have to take band which I enjoy. But this year you have to take it twice a week. One of the days I have to stay at school until 7 pm and I always feel really sad after. I'm just not enjoying it anymore. I know I probably shouldn't take it next year, but it feels like such a waste since I've devoted so much time to playing my instrument. I just feel so shitty. The class average is a 91. I am pretty sure I'm getting the lowest mark in the class.

I enjoy getting high marks, but I am a horrible procrastinator and I always stay up to like 5 am working on assignments. I have no motivation until I absolutely need to get stuff done. I just feel horrible when I get low marks. Everyone at my school is uber competitive and I feel like garbage if I get anywhere below a 90. I hardly pay attention in class and I always save things until the last minute. It's like I enjoy making my life more difficult. School has gotten harder and the stress causes me to cry often.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't have very strong connections with any of my friends. I don't enjoy going places with people. And I feel uncomfortable talking to them outside of emails, texts, and Facebook messaging. One of my friends always makes jokes at my expense when we're around other people. I often make self-deprecating jokes, so I am normally okay with it. But he takes it a little too far sometimes. I'm not the best at controlling my emotions -- I smile and laugh at inappropriate times -- so when I try to tell him I don't enjoy it, he says that I'm lying.

A couple years ago I ended a friendship with an absolutely toxic person. I'm glad I ended it, but he was also one of the only people from my old school. I really felt betrayed by what he did to me, and it still kinda hurts. I don't have many friends.

Every single day is the same old bullshit. I just sit there at school waiting for it to be time for me to go home. And then I go home and do nothing until it's like midnight and I need to do my homework. I hate my routine, I wanted some sort of change. But then I got some change and I hate it so much.

A week before the winter break started I found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm scared and sad. I'm trying to remain optimistic but it doesn't look good. I had to spend that last week in class while my mom got subsequent testing. It was awful to have to wait all day at school. The worst was when one of her meeting with an oncologist was on the same day I had band. I had to wait until 7 until I found out anything. That's when I found out that she would be going through chemotherapy and then eventually surgery.

I had a history test that week. I'm sure I didn't fail it, but I don't think I got higher than a 90. This sucks because history was my best course and I felt proud of myself for once. And now I feel guilty for worrying about something as petty as a test.

Now it's over a week into the break and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I barely leave the bed. My passions are to read comics, watch movies, and I'm trying to write a screenplay. For the first few days of the break, I was mildly productive. But now I don't even do anything. I have so much to read but not enough energy to actually do it. I am wasting my break.

We found out that her cancer spread to her bones. They aren't going to have surgery anymore. She is going to go through months of chemo in hopes that they will just make the cancer controllable. Best case scenario, it's a lifetime condition that they just need to closely monitor. Luckily, the chemo that she is going through isn't as intense, so she is not incapacitated. She's still working and stuff. Her hair will still likely fall out in a week or 2. She has an MRI and a CT scan on Friday -- we'll know if it has spread to any organs. 

My sister is in town from university. I haven't really talked about it much with my sister or my dad. My dad seems like he is trying to ignore the whole thing. We're not the most talkative family.

I tried talking to a friend who doesn't go to my high school. He is extremely unhelpful. He barely reads the messages I send him. A week ago, I told him my mom was starting chemo the next day. And he immediately changed the subject to what he bought on Boxing Day. I get that it's awkward, but all I was looking for was a friend to talk to. I didn't message him again until today. I was also pissed that he didn't think of messaging me to ask how things were going with my mom. He was going through his own personal shit a few months ago, and I listened and tried to be a friend. I feel like this friendship is extremely one sided and I need to end it.

I love my sister, but she keeps on pressuring me to get my G1. I know I should, however, I just have no motivation whatsoever. And I feel like I would be an incompetent driver. I constantly fuck things up. I can barely get motivated to study for a test at school. I know driving isn't necessary at the moment, so I can't get motivated to study for it.

School is starting again on Monday. I'm going to have so much work to do because exams start at the end of January. I have so much work that I could be doing over the break, but I just keep putting it off. I have a group video or something due for history sometime after the break. My group wants to start filming Thursday or Friday. On Thursday, my mom has chemotherapy. And on Friday, my mom has more tests. Even if I do get a ride to someone's house, I'm going to be thinking of my mom all day. I don't want to be a jerk and screw over my group. But I really don't want to film those days. Also, I'm really not close to anyone in that group to tell them what's going on. It would be really uncomfortable telling them and I don't know what other day we could film. I also can't get motivated to do any work or research. 

I don't want school to start again. I hate it. It's so stressful and I'm so unhappy. I had so little motivation before I discovered my mom has cancer, and now I have even less. I know I'm going to have a shitty time.

I am starting to realize how screwed I am for university. I don't really have any accomplishments. I've done nothing significant. My only highlights are my grades, but they are not even that great and I don't know if I can keep them up. I want to be a screenwriter, yet I know that it is nearly impossible to be successful. I just know that I'm going to fail at it like everything else in my life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel alone and scared. I'm not suicidal (there are too many movies and television shows to look forward to even think about that). I am not very charismatic.

After that never worked as a manager cause I don't like people so of course I hated the job. Was working some random jobs which I hated aswell. 

 One day I decided to quit, move to the big city and get a decent degree in something. Figured I like computers so I'm gonna go ahead and be a computer guy. Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school. 

So here I am. Almost 30 and have nothing and no one except my mom. And it numbs me. Paralyzes me every second of my life. I can't even enjoy a movie now. Can't watch how all these tall men on the screen live their beatiful and interesting lives without hating myself for my life choices. So I just stuck in my apartment playing videogames all day to silence the pain while mother paying my bills. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing brings joy. All I wanna do is to die.

"A bit of background:
I‚Äôm 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I‚Äôve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I‚Äôve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that‚Äôs what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I‚Äôve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I‚Äôm constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I‚Äôve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I‚Äôve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I‚Äôve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they‚Äôve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I‚Äôm still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can‚Äôt express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I‚Äôm being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don‚Äôt openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I‚Äôm a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I‚Äôve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don‚Äôt have psychologists at our hospital, they‚Äôre hours away and I can‚Äôt drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn‚Äôt react well with me. I‚Äôve spoken to therapists and they have said I‚Äôm getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn‚Äôt doing much for me.

"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit.

I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it).

"I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along.

I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it.

She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

But why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.

I know I shouldn't, right? In my head. But my heart just wants it all to be just over.

When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like ""Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and insensitive sentences like ""Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily"" or ""Suicide is for the cowards"".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like ""Are you feeling fine?"" ""Are you okay?"" ""Do you wanna talk about it?"" and ""I'm always here"".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.

"I'm a people-pleaser. I like to fix, serve and help them, anyway possible  
  
That's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  
  
So, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  
  
However, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  
  
It got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying ""it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds"". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a ""Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me"".  
  
I broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  
  
The breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were ""you finally thought all of it through"".  
  
Not longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  
  
After a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple ""was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?"". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: ""Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over"".  
  
I didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  
  
You might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  
  
I didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  
  
I know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again.

I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. 

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. 

I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. 
They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. 
Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". 

I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

Everything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...

And the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.

This year was a shit, the finances in my house were rockbottom, the health problems get bigger by the time and the success is not even around us, but I'm by my own, right?
Just had a motorcycle accident the day before yesterday and it was definitely a mistake. I'm not sorry for what happened to me but now my family is busting it all over me, saying that I'm irresponsible, that I don't do good on school, that I'm rude. But I just can get through this. I'm 18 and tired of this life, how can I get over all this bullshit? If I think that I want this to end its good, if it does happen my sister will not worry about my bad behaviour, my mom will not scream my name anymore and there will be less to spend in their life.

"Hello. First of all, i apologize about my English. I'm 17yo and I do not usually speak english. I'll do my best for sure.
I'll present myself shortly : 
I'm a 17yo white boy in Western Europe, 1m85 tall. Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )
So, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl. We met each other two and a half month ago. This night, I was crying so badly because of my ex when she came to me and gave me a hug. She took care of myself, she heard me, she told me her own story, and then we slept together. Since this night, we have been dating each other. 
She has been so nice with me all this time long.
Two months later, i'm feeling as if i'm not deserving her. By induction, i'm feeling as if i wouldn't ever been able to be happy with anyone due to my low self esteem. ( That was already a problem during my last love-relationship. )
I've already use to struggle with depression, but what panics me is that i'm in graduating class and I have to succed it if i wan't to have a nice CPGE ( preparatory classes to prestigious universities ) and thus i would more likely get a well ranked university. 
I'm feeling lost. I don't have any idea about what i should do, if I should leave her asap to flee my own problems, if finally works shouldn't have the priority for once and i should focus about myself, or if i'm not seeing the most important here...
Thanks to you if you read me, that was pretty difficult for me to write ""non-academicly"" in English. If i did loud ( or even slight, but it should contains a lot and i wouldn't take up too much of your time ) mistakes, i would be glad to learn and improve my English, by the way.

"I feel like most of us are leaning way more toward the emotional than the stoic. And as a male I have been trained to not be emotional, and also there really isn't a support system in place. Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of ""maning up"", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im ""stable"" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. 

How can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. 

Also, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to?

"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it.

Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i‚Äôve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps.

"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.

Ever since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.

We were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my ""me time"" that I relished in before the relationship became ""us time"" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.

We traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new ""friendship"" with a guy she worked with.

Fast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.

My self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.

The result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no ""good days"" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.

All I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.

"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1.0,ejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future..

"I'm warning you, this is gonna be a looooong ass post. This will probably get lost in this sub but there are a few things I really need to get off my chest. Also, I'm not a native speaker so baer with me :D 


2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. 


I started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. 


I dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this ""life"". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. 


After a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me ""there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect"". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.


Up until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. 


I'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.

Why should I endure the pain the pain of living in this society the pain of living in a shitty family the pain of life itself think about it we come in to this world bloody and crying is it a way for baby begging not to be born? If u believe in incarnation it actually make sense right? I just been thinking a lot 

The sad truth is half of the people on this sub that giving advice to people who about to give up is just on the high of depression right now what I mean is u like all of us here been dealing with depression and maybe u getting better or u think this time it ganna be different maybe this is last time I‚Äôm feeling better right 
I‚Äôm in the high right now I see hope!!! well here the sad truth all of u ganna RELAPSE like everytime some of u notice it and try to stop the depression some of u don‚Äôt and go down to the devil we called depression even deeper it just a constant battle it just kinda funny to me that people giving advice in a few months they be here waiting for advice cos they relapse

All of this is my final thought this will just get lost in thousands of post here I‚Äôm about to turn 20 in a few months ganna do it before 20 I will plan it precisely and as perfect as possible the place to do it the material cut off all my connections deleted all my social media burn my phone and ID be on drug or heavily on alcohol to make my body weaker to fight my survival instinct that will get in the way I watch countless suicide video fail to learn the mistake they make so I will not fail

"I have a difficult life but I wouldn't say it's the worst or even that terrible. But I still live in such unending unbearable pain everyday.

Back at the end of October I had a near break down. I was just short of collapsing on the ground crying, but I was at work and held it together well enough to quit my job in professional manner. Nearly walked off the job as well, instead I talked to my work crew and got off early.  Why did I quit? Well they weren't paying me correctly for my job and hours and pay rates for 4 months straight. I had run out of patience. 

My dad is so sick he is currently living in the hospital. I mean we emptied his place and gave notice. And I take care of him. 

I have a lump in my breast. I'm cancer free thankfully, but it's still painful and keeps me from going back to work. It feels like a red hot poker beneath my skin when I get too active. (Sweeping the floor too fast is too active) 

My mom's health is deteriorating and her attitude is ""whatever""

There is no one to help me look after my dad because no one likes him, not even me. I can't stand the asshole. He throws his urinals at the nurses! 

My oldest brother has heart problems 

My middle brother doesn't act like he cares about family but his friends have out right called me a liar.

I can't handle life. I just can't. I try and ask for help and I get no where.

I could write a book on all that's bothering me. But it's this depression that is killing me. And when I'm feeling ""better"" I really fear that in my low moments I might actually kill myself. I live with suicidal thoughts at any given moment of the day. I can be laughing with someone then as soon as the smile fades I'm back to thinking about killing myself. Most mornings those suicidal feelings are so intense that I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I get out of bed.

I was really scared because I've never had a girlfriend and the one time I asked someone I was rejected and I'm terrible at speaking to people and I just freeze up when I get nervous which was definitely happening now. I tried to talk to her and of course I froze up and made everything awkward and ruined everything.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really want to live but I know I'm not going to commit suicide.

Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things..

"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression.  Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.  I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling.

I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy.  She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it.

"As the title says, my birthday is Saturday. The past 20 years I've never had a good birthday. My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).

 As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.
 Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.

 Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...

My friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in,  saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. 

Time passes. 

Moments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says ""we should all do something Friday""...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and ""we should be going out Friday for Matt"". C responds with ""that's fine"". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... 

I told them  ""We don't have to for me"" ""I would rather you guys have a full night"". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated. I'm just a waste of space.

 I'm probably being over dramatic and acting like a child seeking attention. But I know this post will waste away in the void. Nothing is genuine.

"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

"So on boxing day, the people I live with (Dad, step mom, step sister and little brother) went to stay at my step moms dads as it's a bit of a tradition. So I went to my moms house.

Hopefully getting drunk... again...
So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. 

So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. 

She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. 

Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that.

Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all.

I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point.

Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up.


So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole.


People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore.


Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.
I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically.

"I'm a 20 year-old female. I've been having depression for the last 5 years, with a peak in my 15-16. I used to cut myself, but then my parents found out about it and, seeing their horrified expression and how they handled it, I promised not to do it again. They helped me out though. I finished college and got into university, but still I was pretty depressed and had a few guys in my romantic life. Last year I met this wonderful guy who is my actual boyfriend. He's loving, caring, sweet and very in love with me. I couldn't really ask for more: i have a family, I'm pretty good at uni, have a boyfriend and everything. But still, my demons keep haunting me. I know it sounds horrible to say, but I really wish I was dead. I don't know, I see the bad in everything: i hate myself, i don't like my body even though many boys told me i'm beautiful, i wanna cut again, i hate how i am, my voice, my hands, my legs, my hair, my shyness, my behaviuor, my life. But I can't take it away, since this many people love me.. And I feel bad just by imagining how harsh it'd be for them to know about my death.
I can't cope with these thoughts that seem only to get stronger lately, I feel it even more when I'm stressed and the minimum stupid bad thing that happens or that is said to me makes me suicidal. Like really, I'd really want to jump off somewhere really high.
I can't go to a psychiatrist, since I hate being a burden to anyone.

"Hello, this is my first post here. Sorry if it breaks any of the rules. I am an 18 yr old male in my freshman year of college. I'm not very smart and I have to take English 48 in the community college I go to since I failed Freshman English twice, had to retake Sophomore English and struggled through all my other English classes. Anyways, as the title of my post suggests I had a new English class start today. I was able to wake up and had the energy to get out of bed and get ready, but then I couldn't get myself to get up and actually go to the class. I was supposed to print out a syllabus but I didn't do that and I think I need to get a textbook for the class but I haven't checked and haven't done anything to get ready for this class.

"Okay, so here is the entire situation.

Growing up my 24M brother was bullied horribly by his peers and even at home my Dad was like your typical Asian dad and would be strict with him as he did not get good grades.

My dad would often say that he did not care if my brother had serious health issues so long as he got good grades and never gave him any freedom be it being up late or getting up a bit late in the morning.

Hence I became his only source of comfort and he used to talk to me and make me laugh.

Now with me, I had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that I was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.

Now my brother when he was 16 and I was 13 came to me with a weird request. He said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.

He said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since I was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once I turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.

I flatly refused and said that I wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience HS life

That's it.

He stopped talking to me from that day and I never made that much of an effort.

After my first break up, I was asked out by the most popular by of HS who I later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.

I promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.

His says that ever since I started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that I had put my social life ar more than his comfort

He moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,

He has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,

My dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time job

He lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.

Now I THOUGHT once school life is over, He would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as before

BOY was I wrong.

He wants nothing to do with both me and my father, He says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.

He says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished I had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.

I thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. I could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.

HE SAYS he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL if and when he passes away.

Says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.

I do not know what to do as I was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. Do I cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand How I help him)

it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can‚Äôt get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it‚Äôs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i‚Äôm going to do in the future, a job, etc. 

the whole episode lasted half an hour or so.

i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this??

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind.

So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me.

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didn‚Äôt even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasn‚Äôt reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I don‚Äôt think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasn‚Äôt able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

My boyfriend and his family and some friends sat around the dinner table on New Years Eve and we talked about our New Years resolutions. When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017.

"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed.

It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

"Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome.

"I seriously don't know what is wrong with me.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me.

"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm eventually going to kill myself‚Äù into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl‚Äôs hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch ‚Äúfilms.‚Äù I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn‚Äôt give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5‚Äô10‚Äô‚Äô, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don‚Äôt think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I won‚Äôt make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me. I just want hope that someday these feelings will subside.",1.0,"i am struggling from a crippling loneliness, i had a crippling insecurity about my body image"
"I remember the past few weeks were the ones in the summer where I wasn't able to see you much. I felt so sick, not because I couldnt see you, but because I knew I would. The fact that everytime I seen you, you acted as if you loved me so much. Why did you? I never understood and I couldnt comprehend. I didnt believe you the slightest. And even the day I broke it off with you for the first time, I didnt understand why you seemed to be on the verge of crying. I didn't even say it out loud that I thought we weren't going to last, you just read me like a book. Whenever you read me, did i seem pathetic? All I felt was numb. My heartless self watched you walk away, and the last feeling id feel for a long time walked away too. I wish I could tell you about it all. I loved you so much. I tell these lies, apologizing how I didnt appreciate you enough then, telling lies to my friends about how I really felt. My only desire was to die, the quickest way to get it done was to get rid of you. In the end, I didnt die, but at the same time I did. I didn't even have enough energy to tie a knot or swallow any meds, it even felt so heavy to blink. Im horrible for acting like i hated you after, you acted like you hated me. I dont blame you for it, for me it was just a way to not let my pride down. We grew back together, we were so close. It got to the point we felt for eachother again. But I didnt understand why I was still fucking numb. I didnt want to be with you, I wasnt ready. I wanted to die. Everytime I almost did it, id somehow end up back where I started. I hurt you so much. Somehow, some way, we got through it. You never found out how I really felt. We made it. Im better. I love you so much. Everyday I'm wallowing in self hatred, because of the pain I caused you. Yet you had believed you were in the wrong? I don't understand that, i never will. You're always in my mind. I want to die, but I push through it for you. So I can see you once again every day. My greatest fear, will be the day you say ""I love you"" for the very last time.",4.0,"you acted as if you loved me , lies to my friends , felt for each other , you never found how i really felt "

"I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. 

In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.


I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.
I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'
I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.
But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!


I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)

Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.
Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.


I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.


I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.
I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)
I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.


For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.
My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.
In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.

I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)
I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.

"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasn‚Äôt happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didn‚Äôt have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasn‚Äôt. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, I‚Äôm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If you‚Äôve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where I‚Äôm not struggling with my mind.

"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this.

"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you‚Äôre in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you‚Äôll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn‚Äôt want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn‚Äôt want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don‚Äôt want to kill your tyrant, you‚Äôll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you‚Äôll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won‚Äôt be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone‚Äôs day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone‚Äôs darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won‚Äôt wish to do that anymore though, he‚Äôll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn‚Äôt believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child‚Äôs hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who‚Äôs

to say that you won‚Äôt hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won‚Äôt be easy. You haven‚Äôt seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you‚Äôll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you‚Äôll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you‚Äôll worry that each step

might be your last step, you‚Äôll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you‚Äôll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you‚Äôll look up and realise that the sun isn‚Äôt as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you‚Äôll see a path, and you‚Äôll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don‚Äôt want him? What if I don‚Äôt love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don‚Äôt even love you anymore? You‚Äôve been gone

for so long, what if I‚Äôve stopped waiting? What if I‚Äôve given up? What if I‚Äôve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you‚Äôve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. I‚Äôve been worrying, I‚Äôve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That‚Äôs when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn‚Äôt helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I‚Äôve seen him in your shadows, and I‚Äôve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn‚Äôt want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other‚Äôs eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I‚Äôve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I‚Äôve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight, we don‚Äôt want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don‚Äôt want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don‚Äôt want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I‚Äôm not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",0.0,

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again.

"Hello everyone, 

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life.

I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups.

You fucks on the Suicide Prevention line made my life demonstrably worse. You destroyed the mechanisms that kept me going as an independent and self-sufficient human. Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this.

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

My twin is also annoyed  that I'm drunk and my head is swimming and I can barely type (autocorrelation ftw)I lied to my mum and told her I didn't drina aorhol (I've had 2 vodka shots and a bottle of wine and too beer canse I lookhway idler than 18 so I never ever ever get asked for Id) in tlhe past 5 hours alalthough an tell she knows I'm lying.) i was crying so i spilled everything about my mental condition to a girl I barely know and her bf (I live in a tiny judgemental town so everyone would talk and she was sober so she'll remember everything ) and now I'm afraid. I also started talking crap to my crush who I do 5 weekly hours of volunteer work with (I'm too ugly and fat thou I have a good bmi my stomachs is large for him to fancy but I like him). I'm so depressed right now. Nobody likes me.. Nothing is going to change I hate my life and lost everyone in one swoop. I want to die I.hate life there's no point to it and I'm already planning on stealing some of my mum's beers from Chrisrmas no own drani (she doesn't drink she won't notice they're gone) just to get me though tomorrow.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life.

"Yeah. I'm a fucking bitch and there are people who love me. I don't know what it feels like to not have anyone, and I'm a fucking bitch for wishing that were the case. Do you know what it feels like to have people ""love"" you so much, because they have to, because they're biologically bound and culturally responsible for you, even though you'd both definitely not chose to be in each other's lives... for each and every family member? Do you know what it's like straddling two cultures from opposite sides of the world but being born &amp; raised in another they vehemently love but also resent because of the ""way you turned out""? Do you know what kind of things they say to try to snap you out of it and make you realize what a fucking cushy life you have with too much time on your hands and a nagging desire to want to make other people think you are worse and crazier than you are because you are dramatic and attention seeking, and not even knowing how much of that is actually true or not?

""What about friends and other loved ones?""

Everyone else I meet is just online and eventually leaves. Fear of abandonment, that bullshit. My cat was my world and means nothing now.

So why the fuck would I care about the loved ones I leave behind. I stopped loving them a long time ago and the entire world couldn't love me enough to make up for me not loving myself at all.

Secretly I do want that. I want someone to love and take care of me. I want someone to love and take care of back. I want all of it and I want it exclusively and I want it all of the time and forever and now. But realistically, it's never going to happen.

""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

You don't listen.

"First off i have been suffering with depression for more 4 years now but i have not seen a therapist. Its has been intermediate with me wanting to do things then not. But now i am in bad shape, i have completely lost track with every one in my life. I cant do simple task anymore. I suffer from insanely bad mood swings, for instance i was just on my computer playing games then 5 minutes later i had 10+ painkillers hoping that i would die in my sleep that night. I now dont eat much at all and i stay up until about 5:00 am each night. I am starting to get suicidal thought more and more recently. I have also gone back to cutting my self. I hate myself. Im just a fat piece of s*** in high school that im the butt end of every joke. I dont want to be made fun of anymore, When i do go to a friends house my parents make fun of me because they think im a nerd that hangs out with other nerds. I am just tired of all of this. I want it to end. Im a failure to my parents, my friends, my self. I have started to not talk to any of my friends. I know it would help to talk to them but they don‚Äôt understand anything i say. They just say ‚ÄúHaHa Same‚Äù ironically. They think im joking but im not, my hole life has become a joke for others. Its hard for me to just get the motivation to get up on a weekend.

"My boyfriend dumped me yesterday and I was very depressed and down so I asked my ex's friend if he wanted to hang out and talk. We met and had coffee this afternoon and we talked and laughed. At the end he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. I said yes.
However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while.

"I've never posted before but I feel at a loss and can't seem to find anything online similar so figured I'd post. 
Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don't know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.",4.0,"my boyfriend called he was checking into a mental hospital, i wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend, i feel at a loss"
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"So I‚Äôve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I‚Äôm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I‚Äôll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn‚Äôt want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I‚Äôve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can‚Äôt wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I‚Äôm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I‚Äôll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again.

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. 

---

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out.

I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again.

"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway ‚Äî perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus ‚Äî  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it ‚Äì  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I‚Äôm very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I‚Äôve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I‚Äôm in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not bias drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I‚Äôm pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can‚Äôt change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it‚Äôs just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i‚Äôm just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn‚Äôt even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it‚Äôs yours but in reality it isn‚Äôt. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn‚Äôt even your own perception it‚Äôs just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it‚Äôd be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù meaning, etc.",3.0,
"So I have depression, but generally I consider it more or less... I don't know... in remission?

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl.

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so.

I'm stuck.

"Hello all. I‚Äôm a college freshman home for winter break. I‚Äôm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I‚Äôve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did).

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Sara‚Äôs house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Sara‚Äôs office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derek‚Äôs and he asks me why I didn‚Äôt ask her for her number I tell him that I didn‚Äôt want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Sara‚Äôs ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?

"Yesterday it was the 31st. My aunt's birthday. She is 70 years old.

I used the last bit of my money to buy her pizza, wings, and fries. You know, to treat her. I even massaged her back. I offered to do other stuff for her should she need it, like I always do.

Do you know what happened in the end? She stormed out of my apartment, screaming at me about how much she hates me for ""envying"" her. She randomly brought up topics of the past. Some of which aren't true, such as her saying I abused my cousin back when he lived near me. I've treated her to so much in the past few months, and I thought such a nice gesture would make her happy. I guess not.

""If this is my last day on Earth, good, because now you know the truth.""

An actual quote from her.

Yesterday, on the 31st, I tried to be a good person. I was left crying in my bedroom instead. Now it's 2018. And things look bleak. My boyfriend recently broke up with me. During my relationship with him, I was the happiest I have been in a long time, perhaps ever. I had 0 suicidal thoughts while in that relationship. Now it feels like he's ignoring me despite wanting to just ""be friends"".

"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... 

So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up...

"I met Annie in 5th grade (I am in 6th grade now),In 5th grade,there was this camp where we are supposed to go to,we were supposed to make new friends and know each other better,fuck all,that shit was completely neglected throughout the whole time,The camp was where I first started to like Annie.

How we first talked was fucking stupid.on the first day (Night),we were supposed to prepare for a dance,there was this open area where we would practice,that time,I was bored af,I had no intrest in dancing,being the fuckface introvert I am,I looked around,and saw this screen-door thing,which led to what looked like complete darkness,I mumbled ""Hmm,what's in there"",Then out of nowhere,Annie said ""I don't know,you go in first and tell me""
At this point,I could take the oppurtuinity to introduce myself,try to start a conversation,or get to know her better,but instead,I said ""Nah,ladies first!"" Till this day I still question my past.By the way,Annie was awkward and witty,exactly the same shit as I was,so at that point,I started taking intrest in her.

Next semester,3 months later,Annie and I got into the same group,I wanted to know more about her,so we talked a bit,and my god,she was the girl of my dreams,Other than being witty and awkward,I then knew that she was the cutest little thing ever,and her voice,jesus it makes me jizz myself every time (Joke!).From that point on,we were really good friends,we were talking about random shit every minute of class,and had a wonderful time,her existence made a shield around me,all negative thinking,depression,existential thoughts,would be repelled from that ""Shield around me"",I was looking forward to school every night,and I constantly felt in love even though I have no idea what she thought of me.She was so awesome that even if she friendzoned me for life,I would still remain cheerful.

We had too much fun,our teacher fucking seperrated us,immediately,I went from ecstatic to suicidal,I cried myself to sleep almost every day,fantacising of us together again.

After the suicidal thoughts,I was always sad,negativity could easily penetrate me without that ""shield"",She would sometimes react to my jokes,but that's it,I never dared to speak to her since then,I hate social anxiety.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing.

Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore.

I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me.

"I'm 24  and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne.

It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back.

It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner.

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression...
I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed.
Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why.
So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression.
So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.
I wanted to do a couple things
1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me.
YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.

"For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I‚Äôm not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I ‚Äúblew up‚Äù often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn‚Äôt feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent‚Äôs situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.

-------------------

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn‚Äôt. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.

**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**

* Arrogance

* Godlike feelings and delusions

Example: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):

&gt;I feel another late night coming up

&gt;See nobody understands

&gt;But you fo

&gt;Do

&gt;I'm a fucking genius

&gt;You know I was watching this show

&gt;This guy

&gt;He says

&gt;""I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.""

&gt;Great great quote

&gt;And I'm reading this book

&gt;On prioritizing what's important

&gt;There's so much for me to clear out

&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay

&gt;My paranoia's also back

&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do
	
&gt;I'm so fucking amazing

&gt;There's so mich

&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops

&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300

&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden

&gt;I'm going to get essay published

**Feeling out of touch with reality**

This one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this it‚Äôs as if my life is a movie, and I‚Äôm watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I can‚Äôt stop myself. It‚Äôs a strong feeling and loss of self control.

**Increased agitation**

Once again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. 

**Strange delusions**

This one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.

**Racing thoughts**

**Anxiety**

* Sick stomach feelings

* Shaky self

* Feeling of ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù mentally

**Work motivation**

* Feel the need to do a ton of work

**Increased mistakes**

As was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts that‚Äôs something I rarely do. For the past year or so I‚Äôve refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.

Example: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.

**Memory problems**

* Tend to forget things more

**Feeling disconnected from self**

I really need to write this one out. I‚Äôve been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know it‚Äôs me, I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs me. I feel as if I‚Äôm losing myself. I don‚Äôt really know how to put it, but I just feel like I‚Äôm not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm me. 

**Loss of hunger and appetite**

**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**

* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.

**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**

* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal

* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason

* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger

**Increased creativity**

====================

How this has impacted my life:

I‚Äôve been more sociable, more likable in a sense. I‚Äôve also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. I‚Äôve lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.

One time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling ""high""(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.

I‚Äôve lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I can‚Äôt control them. Once in an argument with my mom I‚Äôve said some things I regret.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.

-------------------

Downs:

**Apathy**

* Loss of interest in activities

* Lack of motivation to do anything, really

**Fatigue**

* Even after getting plenty of sleep

**Increased hunger and appetite**

* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger

**General feelings of hopelessness**

* Feeling like things don‚Äôt matter, like nothing matters

**Suicidal thoughts**

* Self explanatory, wanting to die

**Hatred for self**

* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well

**Loss of energy**

Most days I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.
Feelings and hope for nonexistence

Not exactly suicidal, but some days I didn‚Äôt want to exist in the first place. 

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Throughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasn‚Äôt keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didn‚Äôt really want to see anybody.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.

-------------------

Mix:

Twice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.

&gt;December 8

&gt;December 8

 &gt;I am not okay


&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months

&gt;The depression and the mild insanity

&gt;I‚Äôm filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I can‚Äôt and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I won‚Äôt

&gt;I swear I‚Äôm at war with myself right now

&gt;I‚Äôm isolating myself before I do something I will regret

&gt;I‚Äôve already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.

&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but I‚Äôm laughing and happy and crying inside

&gt;I‚Äôm not okay

&gt;I‚Äôm bouncing back and forth and I hate it

&gt;I want to do so much but I‚Äôm hollow

&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE

&gt;HELP

&gt;NOTHING HELPS 		

&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I can‚Äôt go downstairs I‚Äôm too unstable

The other time this happened I failed to record anything.

--------------------

To Conclude:

I‚Äôm not the kind to self diagnose myself, I don‚Äôt overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately I‚Äôve been searching around and researching what I‚Äôm feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what I‚Äôm feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything I‚Äôm feeling.

My mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I don‚Äôt think so, this just doesn‚Äôt feel right, even in my condition. I‚Äôve already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.

My father told me that I‚Äôm fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. I‚Äôve experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when I‚Äôm up, including mood swings, it‚Äôs all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

A brief run down of my life:

I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest.

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.

Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door

I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.

i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about.

I have nightmares almost every single night.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2.0,"tuition sucks ,apply to scholarships, to pay out all these loans, feeling lonely,  alone"

"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about.  I mean, if I am depressed on May 3rd, I am not also upset that I was depressed on May 3rd last year too, because it cannot help but escape my notice.  But I know I was depressed on New Year's Eve of 2016, and every year I can remember before that.  It's the same every year, and that makes me feel even worse than I normally do.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable.  Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse.  I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed.  Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away.  But every year have to realize that I was wrong.  I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier this year, but now I realize that I was wrong last year and I will be wrong this year too.

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬† Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"Hey Reddit. I‚Äôve been debating posting on here for a while but I‚Äôm having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I‚Äôm 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I‚Äôm slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I‚Äôm in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I‚Äôm still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I‚Äôve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I‚Äôm in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I‚Äôm settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don‚Äôt have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I‚Äôm ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can‚Äôt walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm a giant burden. She‚Äôs so amazing and I feel like I don‚Äôt offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don‚Äôt believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can‚Äôt accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can‚Äôt accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don‚Äôt know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...",2.0,"lost my father and my grandmother, still staty with my mom, i travel for my jobi have to find surgeon and probably burden"

"I want to start by saying that I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to address my mental health. But I have so much going on in my head, and I feel a need to unload my feelings. 

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc√© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc√©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

Honestly it's really hard for me to accept that I need help and can't ""help myself"".

I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected.

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. ¬†From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted.

"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It‚Äôs Fucked. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent‚Ä¶ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn‚Äôt know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics‚Ä¶ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let‚Äôs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let‚Äôs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I‚Äôm sure we don‚Äôt need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I‚Äôve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let‚Äôs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall‚Ä¶ ADHD‚Ä¶? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I‚Äôm doing homework. I‚Äôm talking to people. I‚Äôm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well‚Ä¶ when I can‚Ä¶ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It‚Äôs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall‚Ä¶ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be‚Ä¶ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I‚Äôm not really happy me because happy me isn‚Äôt sad half of the day. 

I‚Äôm cheating depression. It‚Äôs always there and I don‚Äôt give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn‚Äôt respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life.

"Hey, so I have had depression for as long as I can remember. (Honestly for more than 8 years, I'm only 20 so that's a while!). Anyway I think its better or at least subsided now. What I needed on dark days is just to speak to someone, i didn't care who it was but i couldn't. (There was no one for me). So i want to change that for everyone else.

If you want to speak to me about anything (Absolutely anything). Also i don't know if i should've made this new account or just used my old one. (I'm in the UK so if i don't reply im probably asleep!)

"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.


But when they ask ""How was your holiday?"" how can I do anything but dodge the answer or lie?

"my girlfriend has a stomach ulcer, is very open to other guys, and that plus alcohol is all just such a bad combination, she is underage and i really hate when she drinks it makes me stressed out and very depressed.

well she went to work today, 4-8, and told me before hand her friend asked her to drink with her tonigjt for new years and she told me she said no and promised she would spend the time with me

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they‚Äôre great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she‚Äôs usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don‚Äôt see my depression doesn‚Äôt mean My depression went away.

I‚Äôve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I‚Äôm an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I‚Äôm 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we‚Äôre out shopping or something she talks about things that I‚Äôd rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like ‚Äúoh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,‚Äù and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she‚Äôs justifying my presence, like this is why I‚Äôm here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he‚Äôs not in school. Honestly it‚Äôs embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don‚Äôt like standing out.

I‚Äôm pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we‚Äôre close and I love her, but sometimes it‚Äôs very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn‚Äôt make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there‚Äôs a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I‚Äôve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can‚Äôt even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says ‚Äúoh I should have thought of that‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stupid‚Äù ‚ÄúI should have known‚Äù and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it‚Äôs something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can‚Äôt understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what‚Äôs on my mind.

"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks

"I think I'm going to kill myself some time within the next week, but I wanted to make sure I'm doing my due diligence before making any rash decisions.

"I got a guitar for myself this Christmas. My family kind of ignored me this year for Christmas, but that's par for the course....Either ignore or belittle me, one or the other. Anyways. I started playing again. It was a random idea, honestly, a 'good day', where I passed the local music store and saw one in the window. I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay. I was a greek god for all I was concerned. He actually didn't recognize me, not that I don't blame him. I've gained a bit of weight and I have a bad habit of not taking care of my hair..After talking to him for a little while, and explaining the new idea, he said that he was actually here to sell his guitar. He said if I wanted it, it was mine, so long as I promised to play it pretty often. It's not new or a beauty, but it meant a lot, especially since I look like unmotivated scum.

Anyways. There's my hope for the day. I've been playing that.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I‚Äôve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I‚Äôm a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I‚Äôm nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I‚Äôm aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I‚Äôm just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I‚Äôm tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I‚Äôm embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same.

Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway.
I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind.  I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".

"Hi everyone, first things first I hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and family

Moving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. 

I got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... 

It got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... 

But mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) 

So, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a ""way to thank him"" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. 

So he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...

Later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...

He left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. 

I started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. 

During that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and ""just"" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...

I don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...

I was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like ""thats what real friends do right?"". 

But between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple ""hello""  from me took weeks.

Like,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... 

I exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...

How? Just with simple ""memes"" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... 

What happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. 

The thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... 

Am I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only ""if""  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed

She is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... 

This is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :)

"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- I‚Äôm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also I‚Äôm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message.

"So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.

So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June.

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3.0,"intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up,feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health, my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me,prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness, "

"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again. It's been at least 4 years of feeling like this.

"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life.

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

"Hi guys. Not sure where to start.

I hate school. I am a Junior and I am a straight A student who takes harder classes. You might think that would make me tolerate school, but I absolutely abhor it. I take no pleasure in my success, I have a bad anxiety disorder which will often debilitate me. I recently transferred for reasons I will talk about later. Because I'm new, I have no close relationships with anyone, and it's honestly understandable considering the people in my classes either feel extremely douchey or disinterested. I was never good at making friends IRL anyways I guess, I always tried to keep my social life online. I hate my teachers too, they'll often make me feel like they're under-qualified and that I am not getting the material I will need for the exam. I wish I could drop-out, I really really do, but I have no justification if I'm doing well. I'm almost off Holiday break and I have never been more anxious in my life.

My parents literally do not know the pain and discourse they are putting me through. They recently bought their dream property and they've made me move into the the place and go to school there. My life was put on hold and rapidly changed instantly. The place is in the country and is so isolated; half the time I am there, I am alone. When you're anxious about school and are completely isolated, it is the worst feeling ever, and some days I feel like I am going to die there, unhappy. They thought I would like it as much as them, but I do not. I hate it so much, I just want to be somewhere with good internet, TV, and proximity to civilization. Unfortunately, even when I express my pain, it mostly goes unheard.

I have friends online, and we're all mostly like minded people. For a time, it was great because it was the only place where I felt actually welcomed. We play games together, but I cannot anymore because my parent's new place has satellite internet with data limits. Because of this, I have grown so distant from them. Whenever I can chat, I feel like a waste of space. Only one person has truly expressed interest in what I have to offer socially, but the rest seem distant. I had plans to meet these people, but now, I feel like it is a waste of time. This means my social life is in crisis mode, along with my sanity in my own home and with my patience with school.

I wish I could stop everything and relax. I know life doesn't work that way, but if it doesn't get better, I feel like I will burn out and go crazy. I wish I could stop. I'm probably going to regret making this post in the morning but whatever, I just need someone to acknowledge my pain and maybe give advice. I do go see a counselor but I can never open up. I'm not sure why.",5.0,"junior and straight A student, abhor school, no cloase relationships with anyone, no social lifewnat to drop out, parents not know of pain and discourse they are putting me through, shifted to new property, I hate it so much, want someone to acknowledge my pain"

I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something.

"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it.

Being honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.

My mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.

Now I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.

It's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years... It destroyed my life, and I don't know how to make my mom and psychologist understand that.

I don't think I'll be able to withstand that forever. For now I can, but I feel that if the future will be the same, eventually I'll break down or have a nervous breakdown...

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

I'm sorry if it was barely coherent. I lost my train of thought quite a few times. I think the total time it took me to write this was around 2 hours because I kept having to force myself to continue.

Again, why can't I just feel basic emotions? Why am I forced as this hollow, pathetic husk of a person and my mind being a shattered vessel lost miles down in a fucking  sea  somewhere when all ""normies"" around me are full of shits and giggles being so blissfully ignorant drinking and getting piss lit. Why can't I smile as I feel positive emotions or laugh at something funny  or even feel scared I could be chased by a crackhead or a clown or something. Nowadays there's nothing. I don't smile. I don't eat or sleep properly. NOTHING is worth doing all hobbies and shit I liked are a chore or a pass time now I'm just counting down the days and even this year has been this shittest and yet I'm still coming into terms how my attempts have left me alive and why I'm continuing.

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed.

Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

For me, 2017 has been the shittest year for a while. It can go fuck itself. 

So, for one night only. I'm going to get drunk and direct all of the vitriol and negativity I usually spend on myself, at an entire year. From January to December. It can all get fucked. All of the darkest thoughts I have about me and others. For tonight, they're all for you, 2017.

I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark.

* 2017, I hope you die in a house fire.
* 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted.
* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********.

I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore.

"I've gone through deep depression in university from being homesick, in addition to being in remission for testicular cancer for over 3 years. I met this girl through a close friend of mine out of state. We met once and connected really well, and wanted to stay together even through long distance. She told me her feelings were genuine and I shouldn't worry about anything, and that she would not be the one breaking up with me.


Fast forward 2 months to last night, where we met up again, to which i feel that she may be avoiding or distancing herself for me. I would ask if everything is alright to which she would assure me nothing is wrong. I see her texting a friend at the show we were at where she sent a text to a friend saying ""I'm a horrible person"". I kinda figured what may be the case, and confronted her to which she slowly admitted that she's not looking for a relationship. She booked the same flight home with me to stay with and visit me where I live with my family.


I don't know where to go from here. I'm 22, been through physical and emotional stress, and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much. I am going to talk to her soon about the situation but I don't know if I want her coming home with me now. It feels humiliating to describe this amazing girl you just met to friends and family, only to be abruptly let down before we could actually spend quality time together IN PERSON. I don't know if i can have her come home with me, it's so heartbreaking to know the person you fell in love with doesn't feel the same and is right in front of you.

"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.

Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.

I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge.
I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them.
I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). 
I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say.

I put on such a thick facade that sometimes I don't even know who I am. Nothing I do is actually myself, I'm just pretending for everyone else's sake. People are actually stupid enough to care about me to an extent. Sometimes, I wish it weren't like that, and that they wouldn't be affected by my death. The person that they think they know and love doesn't exist, and nobody knew me before I was how I am. It's not like that matters now; I was just a kid. I'm such a fucking idiot. I hate myself. I'm sorry that this isn't too long, and I'm sorry that it's jumbled around, I've been crying for about three hours and I'm at my wits' end. I love my girlfriend more than I've ever loved anything, and I'd hate to leave her alone when I'm dead, so this post was just to maybe help me get everything out of my head and be a fucking sensible person.

"What do you think makes you feel depressed? What makes you feel suicidal? What stops you from attempting it? What do you do to find peace? What keeps you going?

I've had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings. One day when I was younger everything just hit me at once, a family member I was close to just up and left, this left me feeling alone, I also met a girl which at the time I couldn't fully comprehend what I felt for her but she was messed up to from family and all I could really do was cry about my life because I never had anyone I could really talk to about what caused me pain. Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. 

Right now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.

Idk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",4.0,had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings
"I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal.

I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone.

But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games.

So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.",5.0,"constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone, 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal"
"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I can‚Äôt walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can‚Äôt drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can‚Äôt get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can‚Äôt eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can‚Äôt have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù and I won‚Äôt be able to move on. I‚Äôll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I‚Äôm 18 and I‚Äôm still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don‚Äôt remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I‚Äôve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn‚Äôt feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she‚Äôs super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I‚Äôve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can‚Äôt even make myself happy. I feel like if I don‚Äôt go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I‚Äôll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom‚Äôs money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I‚Äôll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I‚Äôm taking advantage of people and I feel like I‚Äôm too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I‚Äôve watched myself literally go nuts and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can‚Äôt even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I‚Äôve fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I‚Äôm not doing anything productive by fighting OCD.

"I have a friend who lives in another state (I moved away.) 

We dated actually... And he never ""broke up"" with me. He just got more distant until I only saw him like once a month. It was agonizing for me. When I confronted him he acted like nothing was wrong. I guess, in his eyes, nothing *was* wrong.

Then I decided to move away, so problem solved I suppose.

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then.

Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous.

But he never tells me about his life.

Even if I ask.

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him.

When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing.

Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently.

It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

I have no friends and have always been the guy in the periphery of groups of friends. 

I was miserable in high school, probably had add or somethign. I was miserable in college and went to a shitty open enrollment commuter shool. 

I'm college I got my gf pregnant after dating her for two months.  She only wanted to work part time as a cashier despite the fact she has a nursing degree. I wanted to get my PhD as I was a liberal arts major and that was the only way to get a job. But I had to quit  that as I had to work two jobs (one full time) to support my new family. 

My only child doesn't even have my last name as my in laws have, over the last decade, tried to convince my wife I am going to walk out on the family. I have always sacrificed everything for them.

Despite a decade of working my ass off and sleepless nights I make less than 50k a year.


My wife developed depression and anxiety and was suicidal, she is now on meds. 

My wife also is infertile and we can never have more children, she also can't be intimate as she no longer produces mucous. I haven't had sex in three years and unless I have an affair (like that would even happen...... I'm too much of a loser for any woman to want that) I will never have sex again. 

My child has depression, anxiety, adhd,. He has been kicked out of one school already. Keeping him stable is a daily grind. I also missed most of the childhood moments working all those jobs and trying to do grad school. 

I drive a 13 year old car that just broke down for the third time this winter. 

My father has had several strokes and is 100% bed ridden, I have to help my elderly mother help him daily before I go into my low paying low prestige job. 

I no longer have my youth.

"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.

I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice.

Suddenly feeling utterly hopeless. I haven't fantasised about dying since the short time I did 3 years ago.

I feel no interest in doing anything else since Sunday... not schoolwork, continuing to look for a job, gaming, reading, watching movies or anything today. I have written a haiku but that is all I have done this morning. I like their syllable structure and it's easy to work with. I have started trying writing poetry a little bit just this weekend as oddly enough I am interested in that.

I have been fantasising about dying since yesterday. I guess because I feel like I already am dead. I can't tell anyone or more therapist because they'll probably lock me up in a hospital or something and that is neither pleasant for me, plus it would inconvenience everyone else.

Since playing this stupid horror game for a little bit today that a friend has recommended, the fantasies have gotten a bit more intense. I am not going to actually do it but it is weird to me that usually my depression manifests itself as only apathy with hopelessness. Now I feel pure despair and almost a self indulgent desire to pass away and not have to fight anymore.

I just really, really want to give up. I have a great family, great educational opportunities, decent health and a family that help me through so much of my stupid shit. I am a useless sack of shit that i can't take advantage of all the things I have going for me. I think literally everyone would be better off not having me around. I feel like such a burden to everyone yet they don't want me to relieve them of that burden (me) and me of my burden (having to keeo fighting myself) and it feels bad.
