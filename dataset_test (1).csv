"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location. Wich typically means fridges with plenty of old food in it and beer, and i had to work christmas and i allready went through a difficult time and i am still doing it. I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of ¬´fuck you mentality¬ª too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!!  Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!! It`s not the first time doing something really stupid while depressed but this is just a small inane stupid thing i did wich can have big consequences for my stupid shitty life.. i cant bear it and its making it all worse!!!

"Hey. 16M here. I‚Äôm just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I‚Äôve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it‚Äôs started to slow down and I don‚Äôt want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything‚Äôs is so hunky dory. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone on this and I doubt I am, but it‚Äôs so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I‚Äôll probably be told that the weed isn‚Äôt helping with my motivation, which it isn‚Äôt, but that isn‚Äôt the issue. My issue is that I don‚Äôt have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it‚Äôs actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôd pass with a C or above.

"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well.

"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure.

I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will.

I‚Äôve been depressed. I‚Äôm not diagnosed, I‚Äôm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that I‚Äôll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. I‚Äôm scared that my dad, who‚Äôs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say it‚Äôs not a real condition.

I‚Äôve just finished my first semester of college.

I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasn‚Äôt on my mind. I never had many friends so I‚Äôve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure I‚Äôll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down I‚Äôm not the one really there. That‚Äôs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if I‚Äôm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I can‚Äôt afford it, when really it‚Äôs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I don‚Äôt even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like I‚Äôm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I can‚Äôt. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúI‚Äù am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. I‚Äôll binge watch a show on Netflix, I‚Äôll get lost in the story of a game, I‚Äôll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, I‚Äôve lost interest. Those shows and games don‚Äôt work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because I‚Äôve just detached myself from reality. 

It‚Äôs New Years. But I‚Äôm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. It‚Äôs unlikely that I‚Äôll see next year, but maybe I‚Äôll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I don‚Äôt blame you if you don‚Äôt read this. There‚Äôs no structure, and it‚Äôs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that I‚Äôve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol.

However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it. I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with depression and could give me tips on what they did to slowly rehabilitate themselves to their former mental space before depression. I know I will never be 100% and perfect but right now it's like my mind is a fog and it's slowly clearing but I haven't seen sunshine in so long and part of me still wants to stay in the fog because it's comfortable and I am used to it.",0.0,

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean.

For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room).

I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion. However, I know that I can do 15 minutes a day. I have done it, I just haven't been able to keep the habit up. I want to make that habit and keep it going.

"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically. 

Today I got a letter from the university I applied to, they not only accepted my application but offered me a $12,000 scholarship. I should be happy, more then that, ecstatic. This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish.

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself.

"I‚Äôm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it‚Äôs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She‚Äôs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I‚Äôd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she‚Äôs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn‚Äôt go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good,‚Äù and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I‚Äôve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it‚Äôll stop hurting so much. What‚Äôs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master‚Äôs degree. She‚Äôs very school smart and has always done very well. I‚Äôm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I‚Äôm going to support her but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She‚Äôs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she‚Äôs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I‚Äôve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I‚Äôve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I‚Äôve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can‚Äôt get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it‚Äôs almost a comforting thought.

"and in ways that wouldn't hurt anyone if they found out. it's all very subtle, and the way i do it is mainly through poor self-hygiene. it might seem trivial, but it's pretty effective. i currently haven't showered in 5 days, and i feel like garbage inside and out. if someone finds out it's been a while since my last shower, it's whatever. they won't suspect that it comes from a place of self-loathing, and i never let it get so bad that they worry.

i will go without brushing my teeth, washing my face, showering, and changing my underwear for as long as possible without it being super noticeable or causing significant damage to my health. why care about my health? health problems can cost money, and money problems can easily become an issue for my family and not just me. and then of course, i can't have others noticing my poor health and worrying.

"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.

"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway

"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere.

"So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you‚Äôre in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you‚Äôll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn‚Äôt want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn‚Äôt want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don‚Äôt want to kill your tyrant, you‚Äôll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you‚Äôll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won‚Äôt be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone‚Äôs day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone‚Äôs darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won‚Äôt wish to do that anymore though, he‚Äôll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn‚Äôt believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child‚Äôs hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who‚Äôs

to say that you won‚Äôt hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won‚Äôt be easy. You haven‚Äôt seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you‚Äôll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you‚Äôll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you‚Äôll worry that each step

might be your last step, you‚Äôll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you‚Äôll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you‚Äôll look up and realise that the sun isn‚Äôt as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you‚Äôll see a path, and you‚Äôll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don‚Äôt want him? What if I don‚Äôt love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don‚Äôt even love you anymore? You‚Äôve been gone

for so long, what if I‚Äôve stopped waiting? What if I‚Äôve given up? What if I‚Äôve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you‚Äôve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. I‚Äôve been worrying, I‚Äôve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That‚Äôs when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn‚Äôt helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I‚Äôve seen him in your shadows, and I‚Äôve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn‚Äôt want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other‚Äôs eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I‚Äôve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I‚Äôve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight, we don‚Äôt want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don‚Äôt want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don‚Äôt want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I‚Äôm not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",0.0,
"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself.

I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms.  Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records.

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway.

"So I‚Äôve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I‚Äôm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I‚Äôll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn‚Äôt want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I‚Äôve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can‚Äôt wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh).

"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway ‚Äî perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus ‚Äî  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it ‚Äì  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

This is my first time ever posting on something like this and I am searching for some help.  Long story short I would like to die.

I‚Äôm just very lost, I‚Äôve also lost my father,  and older sister. I just want things to stop hurting, it‚Äôs been over 7 years. ",2.0,m kicked out with no job and no school

"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I‚Äôm very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I‚Äôve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I‚Äôm in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not bias drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I‚Äôm pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can‚Äôt change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it‚Äôs just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i‚Äôm just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn‚Äôt even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it‚Äôs yours but in reality it isn‚Äôt. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn‚Äôt even your own perception it‚Äôs just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it‚Äôd be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù meaning, etc.",3.0,

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences.

I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues.

"I'm 24  and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. 

Then recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. 

I've been trying to not off myself for a while now. My family would be devastated and that's the only thing that is keeping me from doing it.

I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2.0,"tuition sucks ,apply to scholarships, to pay out all these loans, feeling lonely,  alone"

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬† Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

"Hey Reddit. I‚Äôve been debating posting on here for a while but I‚Äôm having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I‚Äôm 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I‚Äôm slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I‚Äôm in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I‚Äôm still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I‚Äôve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I‚Äôm in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I‚Äôm settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don‚Äôt have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I‚Äôm ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can‚Äôt walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm a giant burden. She‚Äôs so amazing and I feel like I don‚Äôt offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don‚Äôt believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can‚Äôt accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me.

I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can‚Äôt accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven.

Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows.

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc√© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc√©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

Honestly it's really hard for me to accept that I need help and can't ""help myself"". My family has a looonngggg history of mental health issues, I always thought ""I was the exception"", shit everyone else thought so too. My sister is bipolar, OCD, struggles with manic depression as does my mom. My brother unfortunately lost his fight with depression a few years ago. Actually, this month will make 7 years.

I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected.

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. ¬†From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up.

"Hi everyone,

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It‚Äôs Fucked. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent‚Ä¶ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn‚Äôt know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics‚Ä¶ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let‚Äôs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let‚Äôs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I‚Äôm sure we don‚Äôt need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I‚Äôve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let‚Äôs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall‚Ä¶ ADHD‚Ä¶? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I‚Äôm doing homework. I‚Äôm talking to people. I‚Äôm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well‚Ä¶ when I can‚Ä¶ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It‚Äôs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall‚Ä¶ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be‚Ä¶ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I‚Äôm not really happy me because happy me isn‚Äôt sad half of the day. 

I‚Äôm cheating depression. It‚Äôs always there and I don‚Äôt give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn‚Äôt respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now.

well she went to work today, 4-8, and told me before hand her friend asked her to drink with her tonigjt for new years and she told me she said no and promised she would spend the time with me

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me.

This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks

Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I‚Äôm a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I‚Äôm nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I‚Äôm aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it‚Äôs felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism‚Äôs day depression. 

Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the ‚Äúnext page‚Äù button and it brought me to the payment section.

Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it‚Äôs a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn‚Äôt mention that until you‚Äôve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, ‚Äúokay what‚Äôs going on, what‚Äôs wrong? Oh no that‚Äôs unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I‚Äôm gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can‚Äôt afford it, well fuck off then.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn‚Äôt ask for and wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

 I've been feeling incredibly tired and lethargic lately. I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. 

I've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape. 

I have absolutely no motivation, I sleep or nap or am zoning out all the time. I'm having bad thoughts sometimes and I'm scared of my own brain. I think I should see my dr. about that.

"So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through.

"I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications.

Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about.

"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens.

I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.

"There‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been on my chest lately, well, it‚Äôs been there for a long time, I just didn‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôve been depressed. I‚Äôm not diagnosed, I‚Äôm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that I‚Äôll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. I‚Äôm scared that my dad, who‚Äôs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say it‚Äôs not a real condition. I‚Äôm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. I‚Äôm scared that my siblings won‚Äôt be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. I‚Äôm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize I‚Äôm not the stable person I pretend to be. I‚Äôm scared that others would find out and wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to the depressed kid. I‚Äôm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. I‚Äôm scared that it won‚Äôt get better. 

I‚Äôve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. I‚Äôve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasn‚Äôt on my mind. I never had many friends so I‚Äôve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure I‚Äôll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down I‚Äôm not the one really there. That‚Äôs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if I‚Äôm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I can‚Äôt afford it, when really it‚Äôs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I don‚Äôt even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like I‚Äôm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I can‚Äôt. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúI‚Äù am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. I‚Äôll binge watch a show on Netflix, I‚Äôll get lost in the story of a game, I‚Äôll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, I‚Äôve lost interest. Those shows and games don‚Äôt work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because I‚Äôve just detached myself from reality. 

It‚Äôs New Years. But I‚Äôm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. It‚Äôs unlikely that I‚Äôll see next year, but maybe I‚Äôll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I don‚Äôt blame you if you don‚Äôt read this. There‚Äôs no structure, and it‚Äôs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that I‚Äôve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol.

"I have been depressed for the past 3 years. In the last year my mind descended into the darkest depths. I had thoughts I never could have imagined myself having. However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it.

"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically. 

Today I got a letter from the university I applied to, they not only accepted my application but offered me a $12,000 scholarship. I should be happy, more then that, ecstatic. This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish.

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work.

"ive been clean from heroine for 2 weeks, and even since the unbearable pain of withdrawals have passed, the mental emptiness has not, and might not for a very long time. like many of you, i still think about ending my life every day. 

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I don't really know how to wrap this up. I just hope you all know how much you really matter. Because now, I remember how much I matter. I know this won't help everybody, but I hope it will help somebody.

"I‚Äôm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it‚Äôs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She‚Äôs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I‚Äôd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she‚Äôs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn‚Äôt go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good,‚Äù and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I‚Äôve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it‚Äôll stop hurting so much. What‚Äôs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master‚Äôs degree. She‚Äôs very school smart and has always done very well. I‚Äôm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I‚Äôm going to support her but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She‚Äôs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she‚Äôs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I‚Äôve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I‚Äôve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I‚Äôve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can‚Äôt get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it‚Äôs almost a comforting thought.

"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.

"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you‚Äôre in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you‚Äôll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn‚Äôt want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn‚Äôt want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don‚Äôt want to kill your tyrant, you‚Äôll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you‚Äôll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won‚Äôt be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone‚Äôs day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone‚Äôs darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won‚Äôt wish to do that anymore though, he‚Äôll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn‚Äôt believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child‚Äôs hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who‚Äôs

to say that you won‚Äôt hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won‚Äôt be easy. You haven‚Äôt seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you‚Äôll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you‚Äôll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you‚Äôll worry that each step

might be your last step, you‚Äôll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you‚Äôll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you‚Äôll look up and realise that the sun isn‚Äôt as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you‚Äôll see a path, and you‚Äôll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don‚Äôt want him? What if I don‚Äôt love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don‚Äôt even love you anymore? You‚Äôve been gone

for so long, what if I‚Äôve stopped waiting? What if I‚Äôve given up? What if I‚Äôve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you‚Äôve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. I‚Äôve been worrying, I‚Äôve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That‚Äôs when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn‚Äôt helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I‚Äôve seen him in your shadows, and I‚Äôve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn‚Äôt want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other‚Äôs eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I‚Äôve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I‚Äôve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight, we don‚Äôt want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don‚Äôt want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don‚Äôt want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I‚Äôm not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",0.0,

Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it.

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records.

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next.

"So I‚Äôve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I‚Äôm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I‚Äôll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn‚Äôt want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I‚Äôve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can‚Äôt wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I‚Äôm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I‚Äôll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again.

"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway ‚Äî perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus ‚Äî  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it ‚Äì  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I‚Äôm very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I‚Äôve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I‚Äôm in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not bias drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I‚Äôm pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can‚Äôt change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it‚Äôs just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i‚Äôm just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn‚Äôt even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it‚Äôs yours but in reality it isn‚Äôt. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn‚Äôt even your own perception it‚Äôs just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it‚Äôd be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù meaning, etc.",3.0,

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2.0,"family financially ruined me, husband had a heart attack, can't drive, no savings, stuck in a place,hate, financially supporting my parents, point of abuse, have no savings"
"Started this new med after failures with Lexapro and Cymbalta. After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences. After cycling off Cymbalta which was hell by the way I've been on trintellix 5mg for 3 days now the side effects are unreal. Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don't get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I've never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don't know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I've also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I've nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues.

"Hello all. I‚Äôm a college freshman home for winter break. I‚Äôm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I‚Äôve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). They‚Äôre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that I‚Äôm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (I‚Äôm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while I‚Äôve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I don‚Äôt really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think I‚Äôll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and we‚Äôre still really close.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me.

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬† Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"Hey Reddit. I‚Äôve been debating posting on here for a while but I‚Äôm having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I‚Äôm 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I‚Äôm slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I‚Äôm in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I‚Äôm still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I‚Äôve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I‚Äôm in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I‚Äôm settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don‚Äôt have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I‚Äôm ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can‚Äôt walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm a giant burden. She‚Äôs so amazing and I feel like I don‚Äôt offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don‚Äôt believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can‚Äôt accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can‚Äôt accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don‚Äôt know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows.

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc√© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc√©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

I have been a long time lurker of this sub but have been to nervous/anxious to post anything. I apologize for my rambling, its been a long couple days. 

Honestly it's really hard for me to accept that I need help and can't ""help myself"". My family has a looonngggg history of mental health issues, I always thought ""I was the exception"", shit everyone else thought so too. My sister is bipolar, OCD, struggles with manic depression as does my mom. My brother unfortunately lost his fight with depression a few years ago. Actually, this month will make 7 years. I have always dealt with my anxiety quietly, kept it to myself. Through the years things have gotten...darker. I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected. Content...never happy...always foggy...incapable of feeling anything but sadness I suppose, I just thought I was super empathetic lol I have never found enough ""joy"" in anything to have any hobbies, which has always bothered me. Well. Here we are...about 5 years of straight downhill later and two days ago I started to have some kind of breakdown of the century that really came to a head last night and at work this morning. I am scrambling to hold on to any sliver lining I can find. I am exhausted. I have cried for 2 days straight, had the most obsessive...intrusive thoughts that i cant seem to shake. I am absolutely sick to my stomach and can not hold anything down. I feel like the part of me that has been fighting has literally given up and is begging for help, this current person is scary as hell. My boss made me call every doctor that took my insurance to get an appointment  asap after my...""episode"". I have an appointment for in the morning. I am terrified. The thought of medication really fucks with my anxiety. I get paranoid a doctor is just going to prescribe me stuff (like they did my brother) to get rid of me with out really LISTENING to me. But I am going to cross my fingers and hope for whatever ""best"" I can find. There has to be more to this life than what I am currently living. I can not feel like this for forever, I won't.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. ¬†From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted.

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It‚Äôs Fucked. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent‚Ä¶ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn‚Äôt know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics‚Ä¶ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let‚Äôs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let‚Äôs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I‚Äôm sure we don‚Äôt need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I‚Äôve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let‚Äôs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall‚Ä¶ ADHD‚Ä¶? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I‚Äôm doing homework. I‚Äôm talking to people. I‚Äôm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well‚Ä¶ when I can‚Ä¶ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It‚Äôs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall‚Ä¶ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be‚Ä¶ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I‚Äôm not really happy me because happy me isn‚Äôt sad half of the day. 

I‚Äôm cheating depression. It‚Äôs always there and I don‚Äôt give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn‚Äôt respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now.

"my girlfriend has a stomach ulcer, is very open to other guys, and that plus alcohol is all just such a bad combination, she is underage and i really hate when she drinks it makes me stressed out and very depressed.

well she went to work today, 4-8, and told me before hand her friend asked her to drink with her tonigjt for new years and she told me she said no and promised she would spend the time with me

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks

"I‚Äôm 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today.

Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I‚Äôm a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I‚Äôm nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I‚Äôm aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I‚Äôm just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I‚Äôm tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I‚Äôm embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",3.0,"rapid cycling bipolar, lithium, zoloft, anxity and reactivity increased, dugs"

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens. Things just never really made a whole lot of sense to me. I don't think I ever really understood the concept of school, y'know? I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1.0,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I don‚Äôt care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? 

I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesn‚Äôt speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I don‚Äôt know if he just isn‚Äôt the kind of talking person or if he doesn‚Äôt actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. 

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"It would be nice to hear from other people what you‚Äôre experiences have been like.

When I‚Äôm on my own or with people I‚Äôm comfortable around, I‚Äôm ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I‚Äôm someone else. I‚Äôm frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I‚Äôm socially anxious, I guess that‚Äôs the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I‚Äôm writing I‚Äôm intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess.

"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. 

Please don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me.

"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years.",1.0,"i dont't really qualify myself about something special, i hated my school partners, "
"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below.

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1.0,"history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor"

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public.

People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically biass you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just biasd for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat.

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad.

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1.0,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I don‚Äôt care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? 

I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesn‚Äôt speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I don‚Äôt know if he just isn‚Äôt the kind of talking person or if he doesn‚Äôt actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. 

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll.

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. 

Please don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me.

"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1.0,"history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor"

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically biass you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just biasd for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat.

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1.0,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I don‚Äôt care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal?

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road.

"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house.

When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself.

"People are unrelatable and hindering to me at this point. I feel as if every time someone approaches me, or walks into my space, I can predict what they are going to say to me. This annoys me further.

Ive been fired from the last 5 jobs, all for reasons of using marijuana to calm myself from my co workers, or outright having a verbal confrontation which results in me getting fired. I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i‚Äôve been struggling for an eternity.

Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. 

Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I‚Äôve been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn‚Äôt think that if you met me.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public.

People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically biass you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks.

Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just biasd for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat.

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1.0,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road.

"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment  might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. 

Here's a thought:
Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. 

I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters.. Back to exciting sentences followed by exclamation marks and smiley faces..",1.0,staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure 
"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. ‚ÄúGaby, you‚Äôre such a fuck up why are you even alive?‚Äù I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly.

Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well).

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.


edit: my parents heard me crying and talked to me. my mom says my problems are small and i should have a strong heart. My dad denied saying that stuff. i knocked myself out with sleeping pills but today i cant go anywhere without supervision so i guess im still alive. thank you everyone who replied, reading all of it made me cry a lot... none of you know me but you talk to me with kindness... its crazy... thank you for being here thank you",1.0,"taking medication, realised later on that i couldn't keep doing that, trying to kill myself but caught, i'm angry and sad, i was fail, never hate anyonemore than myself"

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing.

"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I‚Äôve been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn‚Äôt think that if you met me.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public.

People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically biass you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just biasd for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat.

"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad.

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1.0,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there.

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1.0,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so smart‚Äù ‚Äú how are you so good at everything‚Äù then the next day she‚Äôll be like ‚Äú you‚Äôre so fucking dumb you‚Äôre and idiot‚Äù ‚Äúaren‚Äôt you smart so like you‚Äôre supposed to know that‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you even know fucking anything‚Äù just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it‚Äôs like what if I all of a sudden don‚Äôt meet their expectations or something. I feel like my ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is just me overreacting but I‚Äôve been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they‚Äôre next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don‚Äôt talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us. Again I‚Äôm probably just overreacting but I just need advice on what I should do since I‚Äôve been getting more anxious and what they say about me gets to my head sometimes.  (Sorry I‚Äôm not really good on explaining things so if this get confusing sorry) :(",1.0,"blame on them , slap me or punch me , compliments since it makes me uncomfortable"
"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years.",1.0,"i dont't really qualify myself about something special, i hated my school partners, "
"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below. I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment  might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. 

Here's a thought:
Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. 

I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters.. Back to exciting sentences followed by exclamation marks and smiley faces..",1.0,staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure 
"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. ‚ÄúGaby, you‚Äôre such a fuck up why are you even alive?‚Äù I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening that‚Äôs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where I‚Äôve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

"I know we use the word ""burden"" a lot. I do it too. There's more to it than that. I have family members who have been affected by my problems. If I go away, it will hurt them, but one last time instead of multiple episodes. That's it in a nutshell.   
Most people don't want me around. I'm not desirable in any way. I'm not exciting. What I have to offer other people, like kindness, love, compassion, are outdated concepts. They don't want these things and they can't give them in return.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth.

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

"I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time.
Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid.

My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad.

"All my life I've had depression, I remember crying myself to sleep for years at about 8/9 years old, I was always an outcast. I cried myself to sleep because I couldn't understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I'm just not going to exist and I don't think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?

I made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. 
There was a 'lunchtime supervisor' I guess you'd call her who noticed I was always alone, I'd wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. 

She left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn't that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. 

Highschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl's, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. 

I've always been alone.

By yr 9, I made friends with this 'alt girl', Idk what you'd call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I'd ever been. 

I started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I'd play games with over Skype.  Good times.

Yr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.

I quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof 'followed' them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.

People would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.

I switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.

I remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I've always been so tired.

By yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn't like me but I had always kept a little influence over people. My old bestfriend (f) had stayed my friend atleast, and we were still really good friends just she'd found someone better (aka a girl) to be bestfriends with.

I'm writing this now, in the second year of college, slightly drunk after smoking once again. (I had quit vaping for exams in yr 11). I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I'm on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn't ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can't stand my past and I'm so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let's call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I've told about my depression, I've also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. 

I'm so alone rn and I realise that this isn't ever going to get better. I will always be a boy and a nobody. I'm not sure I can deal with the fact that I won't ever live the life that I've always dreamt of and I will always be mostly alone. 

I am so glad and happy that I atleast have her. 

It just doesn't feel enough anymore, I always think that ending it is just the best way to go. To be rid of my frustratingly depressing life.

Uni is going to be so hard to try achieve with my ever falling motivation, I'll try and hopefully go the same place as her and her boyfriend. It feels so fucking impossible to do anything, and I don't think anythings ever going to get better, with a pill and some therapy

"I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while just to see how other people deal with their depression in hopes that it could maybe help me but for the first time I feel a need to reach out to the community. 

I'm a 21 year old 5'6 asian male adopted into a white family living in the predominantly white New Hampshire, so I've always felt like a bit of an outsider. being adopted I've always felt more indebted to my parents than a real kind of love, so to tell them that I'm unhappy with my life seems like I would be a disappointment to them after all they've done for me. please don't be mistaken, I love them more than anyone else in the world but it's a conflicted and strange kind of love that's hard to describe and hard to understand even for me. 

Being in college I have friends who are mostly tall white guys who are either in relationships, or have sex with random girls fairly regularly. I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like ""getting girls is easy"" or ""I can't believe you're never with a girl"" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of ""I have a boyfriend"", ""you're not my type"", even ""I'm a lesbian"" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.
(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)

recently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. 

Depression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is ""Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else"". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real.

"I have had problems with anxiety since my previous relationship, mainly related to relationship anxieties. 

I met my girlfriend in the summer holidays and we dated until we went to university. Whilst at uni we decided not to do long distance but ended up facetiming every evening for hours on end, and basically carried on dating. 

I was really excited to see her again over the Christmas holidays and then the anxiety kicked up again. I think the long distance had enabled me to not realise it was a relationship until I got home and it hit me and suddenly the fear of making the same mistakes I did in the past relationship hit me. 

I went to the doctors and was placed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication and for the next week things were great again. But then the emotional numbness kicked in. I felt absolutely nothing for anyone or anything and it really got to me. Any feeling I did feel was just anxiety about the relationship. 

I want to get therapy about my relationship fears and I didn't feel like I couldn't do that whilst immersed in the fear, so I decided to break up with her so I could get help. I also stopped the anti-depressants because the numbness it made me feel caused me to self-harm which I've never done before. 

I'm so unbelievably sad. I love her, she's beautiful and kind and funny and I love spending time with her. I don't at all want to end it with her, yet I don't see how I could get help with the anxiety making everything feel like a mountain. 

I can't go back on it, I've hurt her too much by breaking up with her to say ""that pain was unnecessary because let's get back together"". And we agreed that if one of us broke up with the other then we wouldn't go back on it.

I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life.

EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this.

"First of all, I firmly apologize if this is long.
I just got dumped and had my heart broken. AGAIN!
My life is so fucking bad, I really want it all to end. I never had ANY success in my love life. Any relationship that I would enter, I would just get heartbroken. I've been terribly depressed before due to my other break-ups, but more than one year ago, I met this beautiful girl (let's call her Sara) who changed my life. At the time, she was the only good thing to come in my life. She was always there for me, she'd comfort me when I'm not okay, she'd make me laugh, she was just THERE and that's all I needed. She told me she loves me so many times and always used to say that she'll be here always and forever. And I trusted her. We've been together for over a year and I really got attached to her. I love her so fucking much. Throughout December, I was looking back at the past few months and couldn't believe how good my life has become, just because of that one person. 
Tonight, she just told me that she has changed. That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it. I haven't done anything, I've always been there for her, I did my best as a boyfriend. She didn't let me say anything, to try and change her mind. It ended so fast.
My whole life got destroyed tonight. She was my whole life. And I know I'm not getting her back. I love her so much and I don't know what to say. I've spent 2 hours just crying, thinking and listening to some music. I feel so empty, my heart just fucking hurts. I'm just thinking of ending it all. On top of that, I have other problems - my mother is sick and I have financial problems. She made it better. She gave me hope. I'm tired of it all. The pain, the tears and despair. I don't even understand anymore; HOW CAN IT GET BETTER? I don't see any possible scenario of my life getting better. I really wanted to share, and I have no one so close to me to really vent out. I only have Reddit.

"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right? But I can't help but break down in the middle of my work day and lock myself in a bathroom trying to breathe. I've suffered from depression my entire life, but it has never been this bad.

"HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.

 This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. 

One of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and ‚Äùupgraded‚Äù the interior of the house. 

Years and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.

I was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.

My stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.

Here, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.

Since she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.

But I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.

She was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.

Since my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.

Whatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.

My sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. 

We've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.

After I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.

I'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.

I drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. 

A long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.

I need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

This is so weird that a Reddit board exists for this, but hey it does. I'm a 31 year old, who generally has a lot going for him on paper (good job, partner, lots of friends, supportive family, health, etc). With the job, there is one caveat, I don't know what I'm doing. For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation.

"Hi, 

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

"I'll just try to make it short (and fail trying) My problem isn't worth really mentioning, I'm a privileged little shit that doesn't have it nearly as bad as most folks here, I even have a supporting girlfriend from a long distance who is also very anxious and depressed. But it helps a little to write it out somewhere. I've graduated from high school around nearly 3 years ago at this point. I'm 20 years old, highly anxious and I've always felt like a dissapointment to my family in every single way imaginable. I barely passed high school, and I hated myself for falling behind and ever since then it's been going down hill with me feeling like a piece of shit for not being where everyone else is. I didn't apply for any colleges right after high school, I didn't make any plans, for some reason I felt like my life was going to be over after high school. I was never thinking about the future but more so the next day. I put off working for quite some time. The thought of standing there socializing or handling money gets my nerves all riled up so I put it off. My parents weren't gonna pay or help pay for a local college so I was kinda stuck here just deciding to do nothing. I don't know why but it just felt pointless. I don't know what I wanna do for the rest of my life, I don't know if what I wanna do is gonna matter. I'm still gonna be a piece of shit that always makes the wrong choices so what's the point? I don't know it sounds pathetic but I don't know.

I lost most of my friends in this time frame, mostly because I cut contact with them because I was so ashamed of myself for doing nothing even though I had all the means to do something while they were going to school and doing what they were supposed to do. I was running out of excuses as to why I'm not doing anything. So two years go by like this, I numb myself with video games and don't answer any calls. I sit in my room all day every day and do nothing and try not to think about it. Sorry this is all over the place, there was someone I met that I unwillingly became friends with but ended up breaking the friendship with her sometime after her mother died. That left me feeling like a selfish piece of shit for quite some time, to fake being a friend. Also left me feeling incredibly guilty because said person needed support after her mother passed and I was just sitting here being a dick. 

I don't know. I can't get myself to do anything worth while. I get overwhelmed easily and I don't have the energy to jump start everything. The future looks so bleak and empty. Like fuck I can't imagine being 30 years old and still in this position. With each passing day I do nothing, the more I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know where to start. I get too anxious undergoing basic social interactions, getting a haircut feels like a nightmare since I'm infront of so many people and I'm absolutely petrified of running into the people I isolated from. I don't know, I've given myself ultimatums in the past. Last year I told myself if nothing changed by the end of the year then I'd have to go to the military but I didn't end up doing that. I'm just tired of it. It's like an endless cycle. I go out there, try to do something  realize I won't be able to stop working for the rest of my life and have to face the responsibilities of being an adult with so much social interaction and painful weeks. Or I do nothing about it, stay at home and don't be an adult and hate myself over doing nothing about my current situation. It felt good back then having a due date. With the military option back in 2016 it atleast made me feel at ease that I could die if things got too bad. Feels like I'm backing myself into a wall here. I can't do another year of this. I can't turn 21 and still not change, I feel like I'm gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Nothing I do is ever gonna have any kind of meaning either. It's getting harder and harder to find a good reason to live if not for other people. It's not going to get better I'm not gonna change because deep down all my problems come from me and I can't not be me. So it's fucked, I'm what's wrong with my life.

It's like a unified depression of all of pasts and futures combined. Like I somehow merge into one single being. And it's just a feeling of utter hopelessness. A feeling that everything is changing for the worse. The good things are all gone. All the people I loved are no longer the same people, or have just simply left my life forever. I see people like my parents and family ageing. People are getting married and having kids. Those kids are getting older. 
I feel like I want to die, and rid myself of this misery that I've experienced my entire life. And I've had a pretty good life, I really can't complain about anything. Other people have it a lot worse. 

I'm only 22, but I feel like I've somehow lived a hundred lifetimes. I used to be religious. Or at least I was forced to be religious. But I realize that even if God and heaven existed, I don't want to go to heaven. I'm only 22 and I already feel like I should be packing her in. Like I've lived long enough, and am exhausted.

Looking for any help I can get!
I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)

I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. 

These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. 
I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit.

"I've never considered I could be depressed, until very recently after speaking to a friend about her depression. 

For most of most of my life, from a teen to 33, I've had bouts of utter sadness/despair where I feel like I'm not good enough or ever will be. 

But it was always in small doses and usually I could be cheered up fairly easily. What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.

Today at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends. We've got adorable dogs.

Our social life is ok, not great (we've moved to a new city and lost touch gradually with old friends), but we're both sociable and usually never spend a week without a social activity with friends. 

I've got a decent career and make twice what someone my age usually gets. My wife and I together earn just over ¬£150K/year before taxes.

We travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.

I find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. 

It's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.

Right now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.

Now that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.

I didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.

I'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.

My best friend, the one who opened up to me about her depression, is my confidant right now and she is helping tremendously. Just knowing she understands helps.

"I'm 21 years old and a complete and utter disappointment to those around me.

I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom  sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses.

Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

"as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? 

was I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn‚Äôt everyone at some point? They‚Äôd call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn‚Äôt shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. 

My point being why didn‚Äôt my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn‚Äôt mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would‚Äôve just sat me down after seeing these signs they‚Äôd know and I‚Äôd be way better developed then I am now cause I‚Äôm just learning these things now.

"I'm 6'4"", 36 years old, and have the typical dad bod physique, so it's been as long time since I've taken a bath.  It's just not practical in the least. As I type, I've got maybe a third of my body actually submerged, and that's just how it goes for large people in a typical tub. 

Anyway, that's not at all the point of my post, I just wanted to give some frame of reference for my state of mind. Today I've reached a new low, I feel utterly hopeless, sad, and lonely. So much so that some primal urge to crawl back into the womb prompted me to draw a bath in an attempt to find some basic comfort. 

I'm married and have a 6 year old daughter; my daughter just knows that mom and dad fight a lot, which is bad enough, so I'm trying to spare her in any way I can manage. It's impossible not to let depression impact a close family relationship, even when it's the single most important relationship in your whole life.  My wife has struggled with depression herself, but she's little help in this situation, and often only serves to make it worse. 

As I sit here in the tub, mostly exposed to the cold air, partially submerged in rapidly cooling water, I'm trying to figure out how I even got here. Did I really make such poor decisions in my life? Is everything that has brought me to this state entirely my fault? And that's when it hit me; the ultimate analogy for life as it applies to my current situation: Life is a journey. This is not a new metaphor for life, and all of what just occurred to me has likely occurred to many others, but it was an important revelation that I at least wanted to share. 

Life is a journey, we all have to make choices that determine where we'll end up; our ultimate destination. I have always known that I've made poor decisions in my life that have put me on a more difficult path, but I've also had circumstances outside of my control that have also had significant impact. Some people are fortunate enough to have support and guidance in their journey, from people who have done well or been lucky in their life choices. That's wonderful, I envy that tremendously. 

For those of us who didn't have that benefit, it means flying blind a lot of the time. Imagine that you are driving somewhere really far off that you've never been to before and all you've got is a super vague map with most of the route completely missing. Sure everyone's life is like that to a degree, but some people have those they can ask for directions, people who are invested in their successful journey. A lot of us don't have that, so every turn is a roll of the dice. Some get it right, some get it wrong, some find immediate disaster. 

I feel like the last fifteen years or more, aside from having my daughter, almost every single decision has made my journey more and more difficult, and taken me further from where I want to be. I feel like a refugee in my own life.

In the analogy of life being a journey, there is no going back and making course corrections. I can't go back to the intersection of Work and College and make a different choice despite the circumstances, I can only try to keep going towards my destination and hope to find that intersection again. You can only move forward, there is no going back, so it's easy to just get completely and utterly lost. 

Now, as I've said, I know I'm here because of my own poor decisions, but is it fair that I be stuck here indefinitely? I don't have people I can ask for help. I don't have resources to pay somebody to care about my well-being.

"I'm not really expecting sympathy as I know what I did was wrong.  Note, this is going to be long lol.

So basically I've been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  We were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that I was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  This was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it I deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who I was.  

Now, this ""relationship"" lasted through November and December which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why I couldn't meet him since we both live in the same area.  He was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  He was everything that I wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  What made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.

Over time I just stopped sending him photos and he didn't care he thought I was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  I wanted to tell him badly but before I did I sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how I looked.  Obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  I was a wreak, and still am.

I told him I was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how I was such a good catfish.  To my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  This was going great.  **Until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  I showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  I was completely average to him, I was ""not too bad"".  He wanted to remain friends and so I did. 

The consequences?  Honestly, I think I've been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  This was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  Looking at his pictures kills me inside and I haven't talked to him for 2 days now.  I feel empty and alone.  The nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  I don't know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  I think I've fallen into depression; I feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  On top of this is other things like my joblessness.  I find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything I wanted to be.  I'm not sure if I should even still talk to him.  I find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  I know I can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.

This will be my first and last time catfishing.  I'm not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first ""breakup"", being called extremely average, or both.  Thanks for reading my rant if you're still here lol.  If you're the one I catfished, sorry again... I really wish to talk like we used to.  This is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that I had confessed after my Christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...

Ps.  For those who are confused, I'm a guy too.

I was as young as six, when i remembered the feelings of these waves. It felt like pure sadness and dread. It would get me so out of nowhere too. My heart would suddenly feel too heavy and it seemed like it would slide down from all that weight it was suddenly carrying.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling

That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed!  
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up

"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",5.0,"have no ambition , feel worthless , unfair to everyone"

"I'm not talking about someone saying ""Its all just in your head."" I mean how do you stop someone from flat out denying the existence of depression and anxiety.

My girlfriend's parents believe that depression and anxiety are merely excuses to be lazy. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse.

"Hi guys,

Just needed to vent a little, and maybe ask for advice. I've been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements. Backstory, I graduated university this year with a graphic design degree and this job is supposed to be a stop gap to save up some money to move to a different city with better job prospects as there are literally 0 design jobs in my city. 

Essentially I'm sick of working crappy shift patterns, having no life outside of work due to travel times and being verbally bullied all day by customers calling up. Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a 'piss poor job' - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn't actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I'm doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can't shake it. I'm royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I'm waking up and I'm nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I've been in years.

Also, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I'm supposed to look for something else if I'm unable to start for another month. 

I really have no idea what to do. Anyone got any tips for a situation like this? The company and people are great but the job role itself is severely affecting my mental health and I know I have to put that first but I don't know how to do that.

"A little background on me. I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old dude. What I meant by ""she makes me feel"" is that before her, all my feelings were very mild, sometimes even nonexistant. Like I didn't really fear anything (except for a weird fear of spiders, but that's besides the point), but I also don't think I've felt love or genuine happiness before. And I was fine with that, I liked being logical and that worked.

But this summer I met a girl. For anonymity purposes, we'll call her L. Now, L is the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. We started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked. Like our sense of humour is pretty much the same and she just feels so easy to talk to. If this isn't the place to post this then please poimt me im the right direction because I'd love some other perspectives on this problem since I'm completely incompetent.

Anyways, I've begun to notice that I feel genuine excitement whenever she texts me and I feel really happy while talking with her. But on the flipside, I feel like she's opened up all the shit feelings as well. I've never struggled with depression before, but I think I have it now. I've cried myself to sleep at 3 am more times than I'd like to admit and whenever I make her unhappy in any way I genuinely feel like killing myself.

So my question is this : Is it worth it? Are the good feelings worth the underlying crippling sadness that feels like it keeps slowly eating away at me? I understand that this might seem like teenage angst but I really don't know this, I've never had to deal with this kind of situation. So any responses and different perspectives are welcome, thank you for reading.

"I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. 

I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off.

"Well, fuck you! To be alone in the crowds better than to be alone (to be left, to not try for the other, but not to choose loneliness), to be better than to be with people who do not understand you; as if it had to be with those people. If they do not understand you, then go, go the fuck away, come along, be like me. What is holding you? I tell you what it is that scares you; to live my lonely life in the pile of meat surrounding you. It 's not hard to be alone, believe me, you just need to be yourself. It is very insincere when you stay in that crowd and whine about staying in that crowd and praise my loneliness. Fuck you one more time.

I am not sincere too. Sometimes I wanna get in between that rotten, stinky pile of meat you've stayed in between and feel safe. I can not live loneliness properly. 

To be alone is like a suicidal person stays between death and life. Those who dreaming death, those who see death as salvation, those who want to die think about that because their hope is fading. But the hope that has been left in his pocket allows him to continue for a while. There are also similar hopes in the people that alone. The lonely people waits for someone, wants to find someone. As long as you remain alone you will lose hope, knowing someone, having the ability to communicate with someone. The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.

The only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there. The ability to survive. It has not been too long.

"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now.

My ideal life has always been to have a happy family. But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with.

"  I have been adding to this regularly.   It has just become kind of a therapy thing for me.   So, I get if no one reads it.   If you do, I'm open to comments and suggestions.   If not, thank you for your time. 

  About 4 months ago,  the (39f)woman (37m)I love of 10 years went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you"" in the span of a week.  In a text at that. I have tried reaching out to her, but received only venom in return.  She was my life, my happiness, my fiancee,  and my drive. 
  The back story is long, and while I would love support and ideas, I don't really expect anyone to read this or care.  I just have no friends,  nor am I good at making them.  So, this is the only Avenue I can think of to try, nor am I a good writer.   Also,  this is on my phone,  so sorry if I miss any autocorrects.   So, here goes, it will be long, but, as this is more because I don'tknow what to do,  understanding would require a good amount knowledge of me.  While this is long, sadly,  it's only scratching the surface. 
  I suffer from depression and anxiety.   In the military is was diagnosed with Bpd.   I have never been popular or had many friends.   I try here and there to make them, I usually wind up being the target for people to make fun of.  It has become a place in life where I just fit in.  The doctor said my depression will never go away, and all I can try to do is mitigate. 
  To start, I was conceived due to my mom's depression.   While I was due in December,  she decided to force labor in Oct.   Unfortunately,  I lived.
  When I was 13, my parents divorced over drugs.  Both were in a bad place.  My dad told me if I didn't go with him, he would kill himself.   So, being a child,  I chose to live with him.  At that point,  we moved around to the point due to his contract labor,  I went to 17 highs schools.   Making friends became impossible.   
  Because he was strung out.  He was making me pay rent to live at home at 16.  My mom would not let me go with her because she was bitter.   So, went to school and worked full time.  Until I turned18, and joined the military 5 days later.
  In the military,  people come and go all the time.   So, I didn't make friends because,  well, I was used to that.  However,  I wound up being made fun of regularly .  Mainly because I liked to read dungeons and dragons books to escape reality.
  I went out and met a woman,  who I dated for 3 months before making the mistake of marriage.   While I was out to sea, her and her boyfriend cleaned out my life savings of about  $30,000.   I flew home for us to transfer unawares to ""here's the keys to your truck, I want a divorce,  goodbye.""
  I moved because I had to.  And met a girl who thought it was a fun game to mess with me.  Cheating and coming back crying.   Because of this,  I used to sleep with a loaded shotgun pointed at my head.   Finally,  one night, I was getting drunk and ready when.  When I had the gun in my mouth,  someone walked in,  and called the cops.  So I spent a while in the hospital. 
  I then met a different woman who got pregnant. So, I married her (46f)so she would have insurance for the baby.  Which was my oldest daughter.   The wife quickly got pregnant again and had my son just before I was out of the Navy.  She was from Texas, so when I got out, after 7 years in, we moved to Indiana.
  In the need to find work,  I took a truck driving job, where I received a letter in the mail that I had a 10 year old son.  Long story short,  the girl who took my virginity had gotten pregnant and never told me. I was hammered with support and much back support,  putting me in a position where I lost everything.   The woman only wanted the money,  and while I get I did the deed, after 10 years, I had made many choices this knowledge would have impacted greatly. 
  The wife, knowing I loved my children,  would then cheat on me regularly,  always threatening to take my kids away to texas if I didn't like it.   By this point,  I made little working in customer service.   So, I couldn't afford a lawyer.   And in Indiana,  men never get the kids.  So, she did whatever she wanted,  virtually holding me hostage to my kids.
  Then, I met this (39f)woman.  We became best friends.   She was engaged to someone outside the country.   We would sit and talk for hours.   We did everything  together,  and our kids did things together.  We actually had everything in common.      Her new husband,  wound up being a lazy mommas boy.  And while she tried over the next couple of years ,  he just couldn't be motivated to...do anything.   She then while I didn't notice,  started doing things for me like dying her hair blonde. 
  Her and I decided to try to make better futures,  so we went to ITT together.   After class, always talking for hours.   At this point we had known each other for roughly 6 years.   One night however,  it hit me.  Where I accidentally told her I loved her.   I knew I thought it,  I guess,  in a way where it wasn't my active thought,  but, I guess I didn't realize how powerful it was.  
  Some back story on her.  She grew up being made fun of also, suffered from depression,  and had a rather uncaring mother.  Her first husband who fathered her children abused her, and the second took advantage.   When I tried to make more friends,  she got upset.   So when I talked to her about it,  she preferred it to just be us.   Once I understood,  I complied.   More people meant more chances of getting hurt.  Once she felt someone hurt her, nothing mattered, they were the enemy.
  Over this time,  there was never a time she called me for help i didn't come running.   I actually liked helping her.  Seeing her smile,  just...made me feel good.    From helping her find a place to live,  to mowing her lawn because her husband couldn't be bothered.   I never once told her no.
  After I told her I loved her (call her k), with my wife being pregnant again,  things changed.   She told me she loved me.  We spent hours discussing it.  Like fate brought us together .  The wife, who had had more boyfriends,  one who's wife got her fired I believe got pregnant on purpose so I wouldn't leave.  I work, I pay bills, and I have nothing I can do about it. 
  I talked to the wife, and she agreed to let her move in for a 3 way relationship.   K then left her husband who moved back home,  and moved in with her and her kids.  This was not a bad thing until the wife got jealous.    I spent my time with k, letting her do what she wanted,  but anytime I was happy,  it made the wife upset.  So, eventually things bored over and k moved out and in with her mother. 
  The wife went back to her ""other"" friends while still threatening me regularly.   The relationship with k became mostly by phone and weekends since she was now an hour away.   Also complicated with poor Internet at her mom's, so messages didn't always get through.  Sometimes having to send multiple before she would get the notice.  This continued for a couple of years.   Though,  any time she told me she needed me I was there.   Bringing her and her kids with us anytime me and my kids did anything.  Hell,  if she wanted anything,  I would jump through hoops to try to make it happen.  To be honest,  anything that made her smile, made my day.  Our love, and friendship was what kept me going.   K also became attached to my youngest.   
  Before my daughter came, this year I was planning for a divorce as my kids would be old enough to choose.  And support for my son ended. However,  a couple of lawyers told me a judge won't split the kids, so she would get them. Then I wouldn't be able to stop her from moving back to texas. 
  So, in March, k told me things needed to change,  and she gave me some rules.   Like no ""relations"" with the wife.   I think I understood what she was wanting.    So I came up with a plan to give her what she wanted.   K was going through some rough times.   I had to give her what she wanted without stressing her out.  So, I didn't tell her about it. 
  I spent the next six months in solitude in the bedroom.   The wife sleeps in the den.  I needed to do a few things.  Make it easier on the kids to move away from me by making them indifferent towards me.  Make it easier on me by getting used to not talking to them so much.   Then buy time for support for the other child to end.  While having time to talk to a lawyer,  and start preparing for a divorce. 
   I checked with k regularly in order to be sure we were good.   For I was going stir crazy.  I ended up stressing out k.   I didn't realize that even though I grew up alone, how much being around her regularly meant to me.   Right at a time when her work and kids made seeing each other difficult.   I'm sure I was driving her insane.   I was trying to protect her, and in doing so screwed up.  I got jealous she was talking to her ex husband.  Jealous over trying to get time with her.  
  She was having trouble with the relationship with her son, problems at her underemployed job, car problems,  problems with money, among other things.   So I set out and worked on getting her a job that would have started last week that would have paid double what she was making. 
  In August,  support was over, I set up a date with her.  I had this big dinner planned.  Ready to tell her everything,  ready to tell her I was about to give her everything she asked me for.   I was as excited as anyone can be.  She canceled the first time because her son wanted to do something with her.   Since she was working on building a relationship with him, I got that.
  The next week was my son's birthday,  which I checked everything with her.  She promised everything was fine, that she was ready for us to finally be together,  and she loved me and we made love.   So I made plans for the next weekend with her, for telling her everything.    A couple of days later, I got into it with a lady from work to the point we were yelling.   I went to smoke to calm down, with a text telling me she was canceling because her son just made his first girlfriend and her family invited her over for dinner. 
  I screwed up.  I called and asked if she was blowing me off again.   She hung up.   So I screwed up again and called back like 20 times.   Finally,  we talked.  I apologized.  Then, that Sunday,  we're were texting and she just disappeared.   I sent a few messages over a few hours tryingto reach her.  One, my youngest wanted to talk to her, two, I wanted to tell her about a show, and 3, I wanted to remake plans to tell her about everything, that everything she asked me for was coming true.
  I woke up to a text, that I was smothering her, and that she was done with me and blocking me.   I was lost.   I tried to explain,  but was blocked before I could.   We had been best friends for 10 years.  Lovers for 4.  And all I got was a text.  I tried emailing from a couple of different addresses.  Sending flowers.  She told me to fuck off, and stop being a stalker.   
  I let the wife read my emails to her.  So she understands I will no longer be held hostage.  However,  k never either read them or cared.  She just went 180¬∞.  I've never let anyone..in before.   It only meant pain.  She said I was a manipulating controlling jerk.  But, I never didn't do anything she asked.  Ever.  I wasn't allowed to question her, so, I just complied.  I didn't mind, except like anyone,  I can get emotional,  and at times had trouble not asking questions. Her love was worth it. 
  We used to sit and talk all night.  About anything and everything.   We would sit on the porch,  and talk from sundown to sunup.  She became part of me.  Part of my every thought.   We had everything in common.   Most people thought she was my wife. When we were physically together,  the world was good.    She was going to be my only support in losing my kids.
  Now, I sit here, having given up everything for her, and she will never probably speak to me again.  I love her.  I wasn't depressed when she was around.   I have no friends.   I have no outlets that don't make me think of her.  I have nothing.   I never got to tell her, because I wanted to protect her.  My depression has drove me back to drinking.   I can't afford therapy.   I don't have anyone in the world who cares.  
   If anyone actually read this.  I'm the type that ""everything will work out"" is just empty words.  Fate I believe meant for me to be with her.  I no longer know what to do,  or how to continue. 
  All doors are closed.  I can't seem to find an open door anywhere.  I'm broken.   I'm worthless.   I'm having trouble finding reasons to not end it.  I wasn't supposed to survive being born anyways.   My life insurance would help set the kids for life.  She was everything to me.  After a lifetime of being made fun of, people hurting me, she broke through and made me feel human.  Now, this is gone.  No explanation,  on a text.  I must be worthless to throw away that easy.
  
  This is just more details.    Adding on as I go.  Maybe someone can help me.   Or, maybe my story will make someone else feel better about their situation.   Either way,  I'm laying it all out there.    

  The job.
 
    I explained earlier that k also suffered from depression.   She did the cutting thing.  I won't say I don't understand as over the last few months,  I have considered it.  We spent a lot of time discussing our depression.   Going over the ups and downs.   She had been mistreated by family and the men in her life.  I made her a promise to not be on that list. 
  When we worked at the same place, we made one hell of a team.  She always had the best evaluations.  Right up until our new auditor made a mistake,  took it to our new boss, who was prone to jumping the gun before understanding the situation.   So she was let go.  This crushed her confidence.   While I was able to later research and show it was an error on their part, it was too little too late. 
  Then she had a period of unemployment,  being turned down for various positions.   As I watched her fall apart,  all I could do was comfort her.  Always reminding her how awesome she was.   Though,  she quickly became numb to me telling her so.  Then she took a position as a security guard just to pay the bills.   Totally underemployed.   All I again could do was try to remain positive for her.  Reminding her how amazing she was.  However,  she started to reach the point where she felt like it was the best she could do.  Knowing she can run circles around most everyone in almost any type of analytical work, it was not easy to watch.
   A few months later,  I was let go for much the same reason.   I got lucky and found a good position in production logistics analytics.   While she was happy for me, well, you know.  
  Then she called me up telling me she was done with her current job due to b.s. she was dealing with.   Then she was fine with it.  Then she was done again.   I didn't know whether to push or what.   Push too much,  she would get angry.  Don't push,  I'm not helping.   She means the world to me.   Not an easy spot to be in.
   Honestly,  she's better than me at everything.  So, after I had been here for a while,  I just happened to report to a plant manager.   While I'm on good terms with the other plant manager.   I'm also good at my job.  So when I told them I knew someone better,  they were very interested.  However,  she doesn't think she interviews well.  So, I worked out something awesome with my plant managers.   They would help her resume, then give her a ""mock"" interview  to help her out.  Let's just say , the job paid much better,  and it was hers.  This was part of what I was working on that I never got to tell her was set up.  She would have started today on January 3rd.  
  I work for great people,  so while it's a fast paced job due to ""just in time "" production.   So the job especially since its a larger corporation really a diamond in the rough.   Not to mention,  you literally decide your hours based on your responsibilities.   Making things like doctor visits easy.  With full benefits from day one. 
  This was huge since when support for my kids kicked in,  I wanted us to be able to support ourselves without having to scrape by.  Also, allowing us to do things for her kids and mine.

  Anxiety. 
  When we started school,  she had major anxiety issues with being in a small room with a bunch of people.  So, I had to work hard to make her focus on me, and not the room.   My issue is the same yet different,  as I have trouble with moving masses.  Like the mall is overwhelming to me with tons of people going all different directions.   She was the only one who ever helped through things like this.  Keeping me focused on her.  
  My other issues are more like just missing her.  In ten years,  we hadn't ever been not around each other for a full week.   She was my .....Center.  when she was around,  my back pain stopped,  and I could relax.  She was amazing. 
  
  The move out
  The night she moved out was a messy night.   The wife had been pushing her to find someone else.   So, she started talking with a guy several states away.   K was very...inebriated.   My daughter  admittedly rudely, read some stuff over her shoulder.   
 She yelled at her and went downstairs.   I was told something was up.  When I asked, all she yelled out the door was for her kids to get in the car.   So, I busted the door open to stop this.  I was not going to let her drive, especially with the kids in the car while wasted.   I argued with her to call her mom.   When I went to stop her, she went off (I don't blame her, the wife made the situation unbearable) and started hitting me.   So, I grabbed her and held her through biting me enough to leave a mark for years.   I let her up when she agreed to call for a ride.   I was probably wrong here, but, I was worried about people I loves safety. 
  Her memory of the night is completely different,  as I held her against her will.  She just wanted to wait in the car for her mom whom she said she had already texted.   She didn't tell me at the time, nor did her mom when I called her.  But, I guess I was wrong?
  This was the only physical encounter.   To be honest,  I was amazed at myself.   I think I would have lost it with anyone else in this world.  This by the way,  made me realize how much I love her.
  
    The ex

  I don't know why, but I would get jealous when she would talk to her ex.   He's half a world away.  So I get I'm being dumb.   But, it was still painful to me.   She didn't understand why, I couldn't explain,  so it was a running issue.  While he was not husband material,  she did want to be friends with him.  Have to admit,  I can't be all wrong here, since she found it so easy to get rid of me.

  No one will probably read this much.   But, I want to get everything out there.  Again,  there is more, but, I'm having trouble typing this because my anxiety has me shaking.   I wish I could erase her from my memory.   I just don't know how.   
  
  The bubble.
   She has a personal bubble that she lets very few people in to.  I get this as I have it too.  If you see her in general, she would prefer you just pretend she didn't exist.    I also usually feel the same here.  Our bubbles,  oddly seemed attracted to each other.   We could both deal with someone when we were together.   Split us up, and it was right back to square one. 

  The breakdown 
  At one point,  I had reached my breaking point.   Now,  I'm used to back pain from anxiety.   It's become part of my life.   There however was a time I just completely snapped.   I don't remember much but crying.   Expect that at one point,  and Angel showed up and took me in her arms.  The pain stopped.   Problems stopped.  The world was a new place.   When I realized it was k,  I knew at that moment,  all movies and stuff aside,  she was the one.  The you wait a lifetime for.   The one who is that other half of everything wrong with you. 
  She also had a moment like this,  and wrote me a letter expressing fate, and that I was hers forever.   I agreed and she had me promise to stick by this.  I did, and I will say I have never broke a promise to her.
  
  Now for tryingto email her, she has labeled me a stalker.   While I would never invade her personal space without invitation.   So crazy, she went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you ""   no explanation.   No quarter given.  I'm just supposed to walk away.  Like nothing mattered.   Like naming my daughter after her, always being that and dropping everything for her didn't matter.   I question.   What's the point of trying anything anymore.

"I met my best friend in freshmen year of college. I had been suffering at my worst from my depression prior to that year in high school. Fall semester of freshmen year was the first time in about 5 years that I almost felt ""normal."" That friend was my dorm mate. We were completely randomized but hit it off really well since the beginning. We spent so much time together all of our mutual acquaintances would ask where the other was if absent. Then came spring semester and the depression was back full blown. We both have depression the kind right now where you don't feel anything, and nothing excites you anymore. It started to get noticeably worse for the both of us as school progressed. We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. 

They're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful.

"after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago).

my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time.  About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better.  It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me.

Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling).

The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again.  I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

"I finally got the guts to post this, especially because I just came from a new years eve party and it's 4.33 AM and i'm just in a 'fuck it' kind of mode, I need some motivational help.

I feel like im a fucking failure at everything I do, I just turned 18 2 days ago, and time keeps going and going yet it seems I'm always in the same shitty place.
I don't feel okay with myself, i'm kinda short, i'm chubby, and let's face it, no girl wants a guy like that in her life. I just got home from a party just like I said, went over to have fun with some college friends (crush included) and hey, look at that, she's drunk and is spewing the truth through her mouth left and right. I've been 2 months so far gathering courage to just talk to her directly ( we have a group chat on facebook and we talk daily, 24/7 ) and do something about but there's always that mental block of 'hey she doesnt want you you're a loser look at you', and when I finally am about to do something about it, she just starts talking about how 'she misses *name_from_guy_from_our_groupchat *' and shit like that. All that built up courage went down in mere seconds.

And it's not even the first time this happens, I've been this whole summer talking to one of the best girls i've ever met (we know each other for like 4 years but we only talked more seriously this year) and it really felt like she was the one but then again, all that courage i've been building that whole time back then went down again the moment I knew I wasn't going anywhere, seems like I was being friendzoned.
We still talk, I even met her again today in the new years eve party after I left my college friends, but it seems like one day she really likes me but then other days she just ignores me completely, like for example, she gets really pumped up and invites me to the cinema but then she cancels the next day, i don't know her deal.

I‚Äôm just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I‚Äôll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don‚Äôt believe in it, I just wish that‚Äôs what happens when you die.

But I can‚Äôt take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she‚Äôs emotional. She would be heartbroken. She‚Äôs been depressed before and I‚Äôm certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It‚Äôs awful and I‚Äôm ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

I dont want to sound desperate but is here anyone who can try to make me feel better?
My emotional pain has grown by alot recently and often times I just want to die but I cant kill myself because I dont want to hurt my close ones.
Please help me :(

Edit: Idk if anything Im writing makes sense but I just feel so hopeless and I kind of want to fight against it but most of the time I dont feel like I even have enough power to reach out for help and just let myself drown in my despair and pain.

People swear they are there for you. They say ""I'm here for you if you ever need me!"" but then when you need them, they don't answer your calls, they don't answer your messages, they blatantly ignore you. It takes back all the sincerity of the gesture to be there for you..

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

"Nobody understands me so I hoped reddit could help. 

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

I even forget my age.

I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3.

I love my cat.

I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid.

I told my father this. I started crying in front of him and you know what he told me?

You don't listen.

I have not visited a doctor because my dad doesn't believe me.

Please somebody, what is wrong with me. I go to bed at 8 and wake up at 7, I love to eat healthy because my mom force fed me salad as a child (I don't remember that), I have not had depression or anxiety until now because only now I wonder why I am this way, I do cross country, and I am an overall healthy boy.

However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while.

"I've never posted before but I feel at a loss and can't seem to find anything online similar so figured I'd post. 
Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out.

"I know we've all been through a lot this year. Some have experienced loss and others have been on the edge of their lives. 

I'm not going to be one of those people that gets super excited because its a new year because although its a new year tomorrow is still only Sunday. I've been reflecting all day unfortunately about the past year. The first half was pretty decent. I still had a wife and wasn't alone. Then the second half I lost it all. My wife, my car, my house and my family. I hate this so much. I've also lost a lot of friends that apparently can't handle someone who has depression which in my opinion is a stupid reason to not be someone's friend anymore.

My life's stock dropped a ton of points this year and I haven't been this depressed since my mom died 20 some years ago and I was abused. I miss the friends I had, but at the same time I guess they never really were my friend to begin with. 

Sadly, I feel like here at r/depression is the only place anymore where I can freely say how I feel without anyone else judging me. Without anyone else running away from me. If I posted this on social media people would just think I'm ""begging for attention"" when in reality this is simply how I feel. I hate knowing that I am always one to listen to what others are going though and able to sympathize, but that never seems to be a two-way street. It's as if I have some sort of disease and they stay away from me when I need them the most.

I also hate it when people say ""do it yourself"" ""build yourself up"" or my personal favorite ""you don't need anyone"" its so simple to say when you are the one that isn't depressed. I also hate it because I am a guy and other guys say ""you need to man up and stop being a bitch about this""

"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore.

Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. 
The meds hadn‚Äôt been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day.

I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses.

This is pathetic and sad but, when I am not at university, I just eat and pretend like I‚Äôm going to go out when I never do.

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed.

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out.

Things I enjoyed doing before don't interest me at all. I spend most of my time sitting in bed reading about depression and listening to sad music. Interestingly, the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness. This is strange for me, because I've always been an introvert...I've always preferred to stay alone and would often make up excuses for why I couldn't go do stuff with friends. I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone. I want to go out and meet cute girls...but I can't...being introverted is so ingrained in me that I can't seem to go out and meet people. Oh, I've gotten out a couple times...I'll go to a bar, take a seat in the back, drink a couple beers alone then head home without a word to anyone. And then I beat myself up for failing at what I was supposed to do.

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl. Yay my brain...thanks bud.

"I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. 

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Sara‚Äôs house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Sara‚Äôs office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derek‚Äôs and he asks me why I didn‚Äôt ask her for her number I tell him that I didn‚Äôt want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Sara‚Äôs ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesn‚Äôt want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt even try anymore, it always ends the same.",4.0,"feeling awful, rejected two times in a month"

Next semester,3 months later,Annie and I got into the same group,I wanted to know more about her,so we talked a bit,and my god,she was the girl of my dreams,Other than being witty and awkward,I then knew that she was the cutest little thing ever,and her voice,jesus it makes me jizz myself every time (Joke!).From that point on,we were really good friends,we were talking about random shit every minute of class,and had a wonderful time,her existence made a shield around me,all negative thinking,depression,existential thoughts,would be repelled from that ""Shield around me"",I was looking forward to school every night,and I constantly felt in love even though I have no idea what she thought of me.She was so awesome that even if she friendzoned me for life,I would still remain cheerful.

We had too much fun,our teacher fucking seperrated us,immediately,I went from ecstatic to suicidal,I cried myself to sleep almost every day,fantacising of us together again.

After the suicidal thoughts,I was always sad,negativity could easily penetrate me without that ""shield"",She would sometimes react to my jokes,but that's it,I never dared to speak to her since then,I hate social anxiety.

" I'm 17, and I fucked up real bad. Yesterday I went to a party to celebrate New Year's.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing.

Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore.

I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly.

"So girl I like is very flirty when she's drunk. Actually that's the reason we're not together. She knows that it hurts me and she doesn't wants that. Recently she found someone and thought he was the one, even started to avoid me I'm guessing cuz she didn't want to hurt me. Well he didn't last and was only using her and we started talking again. 

Last weekend we went out with some friends she got drunk and flirted with some random guy again which it didn't affect me much. When he left she flirted with one of my friends. That actually affected me. The weird part is that she wanted to dance with me but only in private but she has no problem dancing with some guy or even friends.

I don't know what that means. Damn it girls are complicated. She keeps treating me different idk if that's good or not. She won't text me but gets offended if I don't text her for long periods. Is she playing with me? Wth is going on?

"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4  years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. 

It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable.  Eventually it got too much for them and they released me.  

It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. 

I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy  with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination.

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression...
I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed.
Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why.
So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression.
So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.
I wanted to do a couple things
1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me.
YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.

"For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I‚Äôm not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I ‚Äúblew up‚Äù often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn‚Äôt feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent‚Äôs situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.
(READ LIST)

-------------------

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn‚Äôt. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.

**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**

* Arrogance

* Godlike feelings and delusions

Example: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):

&gt;I feel another late night coming up

&gt;See nobody understands

&gt;But you fo

&gt;Do

&gt;I'm a fucking genius

&gt;You know I was watching this show

&gt;This guy

&gt;He says

&gt;""I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.""

&gt;Great great quote

&gt;And I'm reading this book

&gt;On prioritizing what's important

&gt;There's so much for me to clear out

&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay

&gt;My paranoia's also back

&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do
	
&gt;I'm so fucking amazing

&gt;There's so mich

&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops

&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300

&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden

&gt;I'm going to get essay published

**Feeling out of touch with reality**

This one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this it‚Äôs as if my life is a movie, and I‚Äôm watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I can‚Äôt stop myself. It‚Äôs a strong feeling and loss of self control.

**Increased agitation**

Once again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. 

**Strange delusions**

This one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.

**Racing thoughts**

**Anxiety**

* Sick stomach feelings

* Shaky self

* Feeling of ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù mentally

**Work motivation**

* Feel the need to do a ton of work

**Increased mistakes**

As was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts that‚Äôs something I rarely do. For the past year or so I‚Äôve refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.

Example: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.

**Memory problems**

* Tend to forget things more

**Feeling disconnected from self**

I really need to write this one out. I‚Äôve been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know it‚Äôs me, I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs me. I feel as if I‚Äôm losing myself. I don‚Äôt really know how to put it, but I just feel like I‚Äôm not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm me. 

**Loss of hunger and appetite**

**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**

* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.

**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**

* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal

* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason

* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger

**Increased creativity**

====================

How this has impacted my life:

I‚Äôve been more sociable, more likable in a sense. I‚Äôve also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. I‚Äôve lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.

One time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling ""high""(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.

I‚Äôve lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I can‚Äôt control them. Once in an argument with my mom I‚Äôve said some things I regret.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.

-------------------

Downs:

**Apathy**

* Loss of interest in activities

* Lack of motivation to do anything, really

**Fatigue**

* Even after getting plenty of sleep

**Increased hunger and appetite**

* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger

**General feelings of hopelessness**

* Feeling like things don‚Äôt matter, like nothing matters

**Suicidal thoughts**

* Self explanatory, wanting to die

**Hatred for self**

* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well

**Loss of energy**

Most days I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.
Feelings and hope for nonexistence

Not exactly suicidal, but some days I didn‚Äôt want to exist in the first place. 

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Throughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasn‚Äôt keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didn‚Äôt really want to see anybody.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.

-------------------

Mix:

Twice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.

&gt;December 8

&gt;December 8

 &gt;I am not okay


&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months

&gt;The depression and the mild insanity

&gt;I‚Äôm filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I can‚Äôt and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I won‚Äôt

&gt;I swear I‚Äôm at war with myself right now

&gt;I‚Äôm isolating myself before I do something I will regret

&gt;I‚Äôve already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.

&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but I‚Äôm laughing and happy and crying inside

&gt;I‚Äôm not okay

&gt;I‚Äôm bouncing back and forth and I hate it

&gt;I want to do so much but I‚Äôm hollow

&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE

&gt;HELP

&gt;NOTHING HELPS 		

&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I can‚Äôt go downstairs I‚Äôm too unstable

The other time this happened I failed to record anything.

--------------------

To Conclude:

I‚Äôm not the kind to self diagnose myself, I don‚Äôt overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately I‚Äôve been searching around and researching what I‚Äôm feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what I‚Äôm feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything I‚Äôm feeling.

My mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I don‚Äôt think so, this just doesn‚Äôt feel right, even in my condition. I‚Äôve already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.

My father told me that I‚Äôm fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. I‚Äôve experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when I‚Äôm up, including mood swings, it‚Äôs all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

"Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :)

A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle... But so far I've met some who can handle it :D My interests include writing poems, collecting cute stuff, singing, and thinking about life and possibilities.

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression. She has been turning to alcohol to escape her feelings and I am not a dad or therapist and have no idea how to help her before she hurts herself or gets worse *without* seeming like a hypocrite because I do the same damn shit.",4.0,"My ex, still care about her ,still  care about her,thrown me into the hole again"

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention.

Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

"Why can't I accept reality and just come to terms with the fact the girl I want doesn't want me. Even starting to think she's playing with me. From the random texts she sends with hearts, to the pics she'll send, the calls, the time she told me she would've been with me if she knew I liked her all those years ago. Maybe it was when she told me she'll be with me eventually or that she called me her future man.. Or maybe the most likely thing is I'm to easily hung up on a girl I'll never actually be with.

Should I take responsibility for my own mental caught ups cuz it feels wrong to just say it was her. But come on how can a girl like that, as beautiful as a painting of roses would be with me.. She loves him.. She loves her boyfriend of 2 years and there's nothing I can do about that. She loves a man who abuses her in every way possible. And while I'm wondering if his physical abuse is worse than his mental and verbal abuse, you're in love with him and refuse to leave him.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart.

"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they‚Äôre great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she‚Äôs usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don‚Äôt see my depression doesn‚Äôt mean My depression went away.

I‚Äôve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I‚Äôm an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I‚Äôm 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we‚Äôre out shopping or something she talks about things that I‚Äôd rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like ‚Äúoh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,‚Äù and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she‚Äôs justifying my presence, like this is why I‚Äôm here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he‚Äôs not in school. Honestly it‚Äôs embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don‚Äôt like standing out.

I‚Äôm pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we‚Äôre close and I love her, but sometimes it‚Äôs very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn‚Äôt make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there‚Äôs a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I‚Äôve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can‚Äôt even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says ‚Äúoh I should have thought of that‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stupid‚Äù ‚ÄúI should have known‚Äù and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it‚Äôs something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can‚Äôt understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what‚Äôs on my mind.

"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay.

"i dont know but im trying to live life normally and all but there's always this 'voice' or these thoughts that keeps me pushing away from the good things, i just cant accept to try my best for myself. i need to stop what i like doing, ignore persons and all just because of that 'voice' in my head that keeps pushing me down. i've really been feeling down and down and down, all i see is dark, my entire universe is black, there's no light.. every time i find a sparkle it fades away so fast. I just ask for one thing: i want to die.

im the kind of person that cant say no, and try my best to help everyone and to look nice to everyone but i feel so lost inside, i cant make choices. im just doing what that 'voice' keeps telling me but everytime i feel like im getting lower and lower. i've already planned everything for my suicide and if things wont get better, ill just do it. i have nothing to lose. 

sometimes i wish i could have a soul I can ally with to beat that voice... im just lost. i wish maybe something could help me, anyone... help me make decisions. idk i've always been so lonely, and i have big problems socializing because of this 'voice', i might have friends that love me but i feel like im just nothing, and THAT 'voice' just keeps pushing me away from them and from everyone. i try to make new friends, meet lots of people but in the end i feel bad and i end up ignoring everyone and staying hostage of that 'voice'.... i dont get it because when im with people and all i dont seem to be strange or anything i try to tell things so people notice i have problems but in the end im just closing myself with my own thoughts and cant seem to try anything to beat myself on my own game....

Im 17. I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  ""how to help my teenager suicidal son"", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

I've never told anyone about my feelings, both ending my life and seeking help iin my parents induce me too much fear.

"Hello, happy new year etc, etc. 
Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway.
I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind.  I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".
Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends)
As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed.

"Hi everyone, first things first I hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and family

Moving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. 

I got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... 

It got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... 

But mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) 

So, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a ""way to thank him"" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. 

So he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...

Later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...

He left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. 

I started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. 

During that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and ""just"" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...

I don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...

I was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like ""thats what real friends do right?"". 

But between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple ""hello""  from me took weeks.

Like,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... 

I exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...

How? Just with simple ""memes"" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... 

What happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. 

The thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... 

Am I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only ""if""  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed

She is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... 

This is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :)

"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- I‚Äôm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also I‚Äôm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message.

I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past.

I don‚Äôt enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I‚Äôve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The bias stopped when I started fighting back.

"This has not been a good year for me, and has not been for a great amount of people, there is a great stigma towards 2016 as being a shitty year, but how many people actually lost something this year? 

Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads.

I'm tired of being told my depression is chemical inbalance or some other bs, I love life, but I'm tired of being pointed as the culprit because for sure I'm trying, how many times I messaged facebook ""friends"" and they were downer as fuck, only replying with fillers or excuses, nobody wants to hang out, most people don't want to really connect anymore, they want to live out their digital identities in real life, real socialization is basically dead, everyone is racing towards who's got the ""better"" social condition, who's got more likes? who's got more photos? I'm not exaggerating, instead of a simple gathering, hanging out, doing fun stuff, chat about life, everyone now hangs out to chat about other people, chat about material crap, chat about bs, chat about how they got fucked x amount of girls, or how they achieved y stuff, really fuck off with this crap, everyone likes to conversate about mundane crap, people don't want to exchange ideias, they wanna show off.",5.0,"Tired of being told Depression is chemical imbalance, nobody wants to hang out, people donít want to connect, real socialization is dead"

"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. 

I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married! 

She told me she loved me and always will. I told her I loved her unconditionally. I wish somehow we could redo our relationship because we fit together so damn well.

I'm scared once my boys are content and moved out I'll be more lonely, no purpose and I'll go so far down that people won't notice as I hide it.

I work for a charity and visit lonely old people. I don't want to be one of them. I'm only 29 and shouldn't feel like this all because I'm single, surly?

"And as much as it hurts and exhausts you, you let them. For me it's because the pain is better dealt with an ""ok"" than them becoming upset at my ""no, I'm not fine"" and starting an argument. It's just what I'm used to - I'm in a loop of an imaginary consistent bell ringing that reminds me to people please.


For you it could be to feel, to feel the pain because you can't feel happiness anymore. Or because of guilt, your own and what others put on you. Or simply, it's because that's all you've ever known.
